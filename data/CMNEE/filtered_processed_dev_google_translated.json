A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense said that the radar system can detect mortar shells launched by the enemy and quickly calculate the origin of the mortar shells launched by the enemy, allowing friendly forces to respond appropriately. The Ministry of Defense spokesman added that it would be up to the  Ukrainian Army  to decide how, when and where to deploy the radar system. At the same time, it will also depend on Ukraine whether these radar systems will be installed in the firing system to attack the turrets, or whether they will be used independently. The radar system is part of a U.S. commitment to provide equipment and training worth approximately $118 million to  the Ukrainian military .",

This system will connect a propulsion motor to the main reduction gearbox of the ship to provide propulsion power when the ship's speed is less than 13 knots. It is expected that a single ship can save thousands of barrels of fuel every year. In 2012, the  U.S. Navy  awarded  L-3 Company  a $50 million electromechanical hybrid propulsion research and development contract. The company  earlier this year   delivered  two  electromechanical hybrid system prototypes  for trial  testing  and is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2016 First shipment in the fourth quarter. Previously,  The British Royal Navy  also  applied  the  electromechanical hybrid system  on its  Type 23 frigate  . The DDG-51 class destroyer uses the LM-2500 gas turbine. Although the ship is more efficient when sailing at high speeds, it is inefficient when cruising at low speeds and wastes fuel. Maritime Systems Command said that when a ship is deployed, using the  electromechanical hybrid system  half of the time can extend the refueling interval by 2.5 days. The U.S. Sea Systems Command began studying electromechanical hybrid propulsion concepts in 2008, when military fuel prices reached $174/barrel. Before 2012,  The U.S. Navy  awarded a contract to General Atomics to develop a  electromechanical hybrid propulsion system  on the DDG-103 destroyer, using permanent magnet propulsion motors from DRS.

The ARSR-4 radar will provide improved location information and weather detection, thereby improving U.S. military air safety. The route surveillance radar is an all-solid-state, long-range, three-dimensional radar. It will replace existing legacy radars and provide weather data to the  FAA  , the U.S. Air Force, Navy and U.S. Customs. The ARSR-4 radar, produced by Northrop Grumman, provides many capabilities that other long-range radars do not have. It can detect targets with an area of \u200b\u200b1 square meter 250 nautical miles away, which is 50 nautical miles farther than ordinary long-range radars. The radar can also detect targets with an area of \u200b\u200b1 square meter under many harsh conditions. The superior target detection capability enables it to identify enemy intrusions and drug smuggling. Due to the added weather processing function, it can improve weather detection from Level 2 to Level 6. The meteorological information provided will give controllers and pilots greater understanding of the operating environment. The 43  operating systems in the plan are  deployed in  the surrounding continents of the United States,  Guam,  Hawaii Island and  Guantaramo Bay,  Cuba. The 44th system is used by the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.",

The upgrade will use a glass cockpit display to replace the round dials of the old C-130. The upgraded C-130 will meet existing navigation and safety requirements, achieve avionics standardization for the entire C-130 fleet, improve reliability and reduce life-cycle costs.",

The number of days a rotating aircraft carrier can receive support in Guam will increase from 16 to 63 days, and the capacity of the existing Kilo terminal will be expanded by 4.5 times. The terminal does not include facilities for aircraft carrier maintenance and nuclear fuel refueling. Once the aircraft carrier needs emergency repairs, maintenance personnel will be immediately transported from Japan or Hawaii. The establishment of the dock is part of the United States' strengthening of military forces in  Guam. The  U.S. Army will also mobilize 8,600  Marines   from Okinawa, Japan.

At this week's air show in Farnborough, England, the United States announced the successful test of a  laser weapon system  off the  California coast  . The technology, developed with Raytheon, uses just regular  industrial lasers  . \"Scientific American\" magazine commented on this technology and said that compared to Raytheon's earlier experiments that used static targets as targets, the technology for shooting down drones on surface platforms is more advanced. Raytheon's Mike Bowen told a reporter from USA Today: This is an important day for  laser weapons , but it is a disastrous day for drones. However,  laser weapon systems  will not be  deployed  anytime soon. Even if the next few  tests  are successful, it will be several years before this technology can be used in actual combat",

U.S. Navy Acquisition Secretary John Young said: The selection of  S-band radar  is the product of careful consideration. What we pursue is that every penny of investment must meet both short-term and long-term goals.  Northrop Grumman  is the prime contractor of the DD program, and Raytheon is the electronic systems integrator of the program. Last year,  Northrop Grumman  and Raytheon defeated a design team composed of Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. The DD's primary mission is to provide fire support to joint and allied forces through precision strikes. It is also capable of attacking submarines and can perform a variety of missions against air threats. L-band radar is used for close-range sea search and close-range situational awareness. For its  new solid-state S-band radar,  Lockheed Martin has  tested a small prototype that enhances its Aegis Weapon system radar missile defense and other mission capabilities. The U.S. Navy also said that this S-band radar can also be increased in size and used in the planned next-generation cruiser program CG. According to relevant sources, the contract for the  S-band radar program will be signed soon.  The US Navy still wants to award the  DD first ship in fiscal year 2005. The construction contract is for delivery in  FY11  .",

Therefore, when a nuclear-powered submarine is equipped with a nuclear warhead missile, the submarine becomes the most difficult nuclear platform to detect and attack. This capability is crucial to  India because  India  The commitment of no first use of nuclear weapons requires  India to have a strong nuclear counterattack capability. The introduction of nuclear submarines has enabled  India  to achieve its goal of having an operational nuclear triangle, i.e. launching nuclear weapons from three environments: water, land and air.",

The feasibility of reducing the thickness of composite blades and fan casings is currently being investigated. Internal analysis determined that the current design based on the GEnx series scaled technology is sufficient to meet the bird impact and blade fly-out tests required for certification. By using composite materials instead of metal materials, the total weight of the 18-blade Leap-X fan is reduced by approximately 76kg. To increase its strength,  CFM  also needed to change its production process. GEnx blades still use the popular double-layer stacking process. Leap-X uses a three-dimensional braided resin conversion molding process to enhance its strength.  CFM  is building a  eCore2 demonstrator  to  test   Leap-X engine  components. Compared with the eCore1 test device, the high-pressure turbine of the new demonstrator has an additional stage.

Tom Moore said that  the ship will sail for a few days, engineers will collect some data, and then  the ship will return A six-month  sea trial post-availability maintenance was carried out, and then a comprehensive sea trial was carried out to test the entire combat system.  This week's sea trials were also an opportunity to test solutions to lube oil cooler failures on a  DDG1000  bound for San Diego from  Bath Steel Co.  During the process, two lubricating oil cooler failures occurred. Regarding the lubricating oil cooler solution, Moore said that engineers have already conducted tests at the dock, but only when the ship is operating at full power can the final test of the feasibility of the solution be made.  DDG-1000  Officially entered service on October 15 and joined the U.S. Navy. This class of ship can launch Tomahawk missiles and torpedoes, improved Sea Sparrow missiles and standard series missiles. It is also equipped with an AN/SPY -3X band multifunctional radar with powerful detection capabilities.",

During the 50-second test, all test objectives for this flight weight engine were achieved.  Aerojet  is working closely with Raytheon in the United States to develop next-generation propulsion systems for tactical missiles.  Aerojet 's goal is to demonstrate a new technology that allows the thrust of a  rocket engine  to vary in response to commands from a missile's guidance system. A missile equipped with a  variable-thrust rocket engine can either fly quickly toward a target or slow down to greatly increase the missile's range or provide better object perception. The speed can also be changed for optimal performance.  Aerojet will also conduct a series of  tests designed to verify the performance and reliability of this new technology, setting conditions at high and low temperatures and additional thrust Carry out  test below.",

Major General Sultan, spokesman of the Pakistani military, said that the land-based cruise missile named  Babur has a range of 500 kilometers, can carry nuclear warheads, and can fly close to the ground, so it has a strong Guard against radar surveillance capabilities. Regarding the agreement between  India and Pakistan  last week to provide advance notice to each other of  missile   tests, Major General Sultan pointed out , since the agreement limits ballistic missiles, the cruise missiles tested this time are not restricted by the agreement, so there is no need to notify India in advance. Pakistani officials spoke highly of this test launch, believing that it showed that Pakistan has joined the ranks of the few countries that have the ability to develop cruise missiles. Pakistani President Musharraf was even more pleased to say that this move was a milestone in the improvement of Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Pakistani public opinion believes that although the specific performance parameters of the  Babur missile have not been announced, it will definitely become an important weapon against India in the future, and the nuclear attack capability of the cruise missile will also enhance Pakistan\u2019s Nuclear deterrence.",

The reason for the postponement is that the analysis of the reasons for the failure of the previous  test launch  is still incomplete.  Russia  hopes that the  Bulava missile  can become an important triad nuclear strike force of  Russia  like the Topol-M missile. However, the development of the  Bulava missile  encountered a series of setbacks, with 6 of its 11 test launches failing. But some analysts believe the actual number of failures is much higher. For example, Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer said that only one of the 11 test launches of  Bulava  was completely successful.  Bulava  Future development has been questioned by some legislators and Defense Department officials, who have suggested that the focus should shift to existing canoe submarine-launched ballistic missiles. But the Russian military insists that the  Bulava  cannot be replaced and has pledged to continue testing until the  missile  enters naval service.  The Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile  can carry up to 10 reentry warheads and has a range of more than 8,000 kilometers. This three-stage rocket-propelled  missile  is specially designed for the Borei-class strategic nuclear submarine.",

Last week, a spokesman for Boeing said, Future versions of the weapon will require a  seeker. Precision  JDAM  will provide attack aircraft with the ability to engage fixed and moving targets. Precision  JDAM  Initial plans said the weapon would be integrated into the F/A-18 aircraft being developed by  Boeing  for use by the Navy.  JDAM  is an iron-cased bomb equipped with a tail assembly and a GPS guidance system.  Boeing  will keep the cost of precision  JDAM  under $40,000. The current cost of  JDAM  is about $20,000. The exact  JDAM  required  seeker  would be a low-cost  seeker  . This  seeker  will increase the circular probability error of the weapon to more than 3 meters.  The U.S. Air Force  and  The Boeing Company  are preparing to  evaluate  the proposed  seeker  option.  The Boeing Company  About Precision  JDAM  A contract for the design, development,  testing  and initial production will be signed early next year.  The U.S. Navy has  tested a  seeker that can withstand direct attack munitions, during a  demonstration test , the seeker enables the weapon's accuracy to reach 1 meter in the event of GPS guidance failure. The cost of DAMASK is estimated at $20,000, but the seeker does not meet the needs of attacking mobile targets.",

    "doctext": " The U.S. Air Force  recently announced that it has  tested  a  new airborne wireless router system  that will provide real-time tactical information to troops on the ground in the battlefield. The main difference between this router and the usual router is that this router is connected to a fighter jet. It is essentially a software upgrade known as  Net-T , designed for the advanced targeting pods of some fighter jets and B-1 bombers. Ground troops can remotely operate the video-enhanced receiver to communicate with fighter jets using a small touchscreen device that can be mounted on the arm. These troops can only communicate with aircraft in the air and cannot communicate beyond visual range with other ROVER-5 equipped personnel. But with the upgrade of  Net-T , ground troops equipped with ROVER-5 can communicate directly through the  wireless router  on the aircraft. Once the pilot activates the pod's NET-T transmission mode, he must remain within the range of the ROVER transmitter and within the user's field of vision, while the pod receives little or no interference. The test team at  Elgin Air Force Base   tested  the range and capabilities of the  router  by tracking the size and type of files sent.  NET-T  is expected to be installed on fighter aircraft in 2014.",

In the plan, a  remotely controlled aircraft released a  airdrop detector at a specified point near the airdrop area to collect for the approaching  transport aircraft Meteorological data. During the  test on  March 18, the squadron's  C-130 transport aircraft successfully received  detector data , but no actual airdrop was attempted. Capt. Andrew Standeford, the squadron's precision airdrop system operator, said using the  detectors  to help establish wind profiles will help crews deliver supplies as accurately as possible. Airdropping the probe from a different platform means that  transport aircraft  no longer need to make two passes over the airdrop area, reducing the number of times  aircraft  are exposed to threats. SPAid also makes it easy to shorten delivery time. According to Robert Olson, a joint terminal attack manager with the U.S. Air Mobility Command's 817th Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron, which sponsored the SPAid test, this shaved 40 minutes off the normal time required.",

The aircraft  completed the pre-launch  test  on the  Sardinian coastline , and the test  aircraft  fell into the Mediterranean Sea from an altitude of 3 kilometers. During the test, most of the  aircraft  performed well and the parachute deployed as expected. However, problems arose after splashing down. The inflatable device failed to inflate and failed to provide buoyancy for the IXV after the  aircraft  fell into the water. It was a puzzling result, but engineers involved in the experiment brainstormed and figured out what the problem was. They believe the balloon failed to inflate because the sensor that detects impact with water was set too high, making the splash appear too smooth. The European Space Agency's IXV project manager explained that it is necessary to distinguish between shocks caused by the impact of the  vehicle  with the water surface and shocks caused by the wind resistance provided by the parachute, because these shock levels are very similar. Engineers rated these shock levels as quite high, but the parachute actually worked well and the landing was very gentle, so the detection of impact loads was lower than expected. Impact loads during splashdown were lower than expected, with the computer recording impact deceleration as 29.1m/s2 and the critical value of balloon buoyancy set at 30m/s2.  IXV prototype  represents a new chapter in  ESA \u2019s space flight technology.  In 2014  ,  IXV  will be launched by the  Vega rocket    and then re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.",

This provides a reliable guarantee for the smooth progress of the  Visby  construction plan. The planning of engineering sea trials and pre-service testing under the direction of  Kockums  went very smoothly, requiring only minor adjustments. During the test, the ship showed excellent performance, which provides assurance for sailors who will pilot the modified version in the future.  Visby Frigate is the world's first surface ship built with a fully stealthy design, carbon fiber, which will make the ship difficult to detect, even with the latest and most advanced radar and Infrared reconnaissance equipment is also difficult to detect. The ship also has the ability to comprehensively perform multiple combat missions, making it a true warship for the future. The advancement of stealth technology is changing the strategic thinking of the world's navies.  Kockums  and the Royal Swedish Navy fully realized its importance in future naval battles and developed and used it.

Bath Iron and Steel Shipyard  is also building  DDG51-class destroyers  , and the delay in the construction progress of  DDG1000  has also affected the construction of DDG51 to a certain extent.  DDG1000  is an innovative ship that adopts an integrated power system and applies a large number of new technologies, including full-ship computing environment, freeboard inward tilting ship type, etc. The U.S. Department of Defense's Office of Test and Evaluation did not discuss the ship's progress in its latest selective acquisition plan, nor did its report a year ago discuss major technical issues in the ship's construction.",

Semoniak added that the construction of the next six ships, which will include patrol boats and coast guard vessels, is being negotiated with the Polish Armed Forces Group. The minister said: There is no doubt that in the Baltic Sea we need such possibilities, and what is happening in Europe also makes NATO start to see the possibilities in the sea.

Saudi Arabia is a political power in the Middle East. an important force for stability and economic development. The sales will upgrade and replenish  Saudi Arabia's  current stockpile of increasingly older and unsustainable  Patriot missiles  due to limited service life and limited availability of repair parts. This  Patriot PAC-3 missile  transaction will support current and future air and missile defense missions and promote regional stability.  Saudi Arabia  already possesses  Patriot missiles  and will therefore have no difficulty absorbing these new missiles into its armed forces. This arms sale will not change the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractors will be  Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control  , and  Raytheon  .

    "doctext": "The U.S. Navy is jointly executing a three-year contract with Northrop Grumman to develop shipborne high-energy laser weapons to quickly improve its ability to fight enemy unmanned boats, aircraft, surface ships, and missiles. Tom, director of the Air Combat and Weapons Division of the Office of Naval Research, said that this system uses multi-spectrum target detection and tracking technology, as well as advanced off-axis beam director and improved fiber laser technology to engage targets at longer distances. In addition, other hardware and software of this system have also been upgraded from the laser weapon prototype currently being tested.  The Office of Naval Research will spend 12 months and US$53 million to develop the  laser weapon system demonstration prototype in three phases: the first phase will mainly complete the initial design, and the second phase will be carried out Ground  testing, the third phase will be  testing on the  Navy Self-Defense Test Ship. Northrop Grumman will be responsible for the design and production of the 150-kilowatt solid laser weapon system and support for shipboard testing. Northrop Grumman said that if the  Office of Naval Research  wants to complete all contract elements, the total contract value and total term will be expanded to $91 million and 34 months. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a  high-energy laser weapon engineering prototype  for the next step of  testing  analysis. It is unclear whether this type of laser weapon will eventually be used in actual combat, but judging from current related work, this type of weapon is likely to be equipped with large surface ships and provide a cheap means of attack and defense.",

The Indian Navy Chief proposed at the annual Navy Day press conference on December 2 that we need to review the shipyard\u2019s construction strategy. And more measures need to be taken. The construction schedule is the main problem currently facing our shipyard. The main reason for the schedule delay was the basic method of construction. India's shipbuilding capabilities are currently at saturation, and the Navy plans to introduce more ships to the Navy to replace a large number of ships that will be retired in the next five years. The Navy has ordered 34 ships from three different shipyards, but the delivery rate is only one ship a year. The Navy plans to order more than $15 billion worth of weapons and equipment over the next 10 to 12 years. Under the long-term plan approved in 2008, the Navy will purchase 60 new surface ships, submarines, an aircraft carrier, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, C4ISR, specialized satellites and other sea-based equipment.  India's   first self-developed aircraft carrier will be  launched next year    and is expected to be put into service in 2014. The second one will be built locally. Aircraft carriers may also be approved for construction. However, the Navy Commander stated that the aircraft carrier must be redesigned and it will not be a replica of the current self-developed aircraft carrier.",

Raytheon engineers will further improve the laser-guided Maverick missile's laser seeker and software to reduce the risk of collateral damage and allow pilots to illuminate targets for the Maverick missile using an airborne laser. The AGM-65E2 laser-guided missile is used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and the AGM-65L is used by the Air Force. The Maverick missile is used for close air support and targets some tactical targets, such as armored vehicles, air defense equipment, surface ships, ground transport vehicles, oil storage equipment, etc. The young animal can use two types of warheads, one is equipped with a trigger fuse on the head, and the other is an armor-piercing blasting warhead equipped with a delayed fuse. This warhead can penetrate the target with a certain kinetic energy and then detonate. The laser-guided Cub missile adopts beam guidance. It can follow the laser beam emitted by the aircraft or other aircraft in the area, or follow the instructions of the ground laser designator to fly to the designated target. Harry Schulte, deputy director of the air combat system production line of Raytheon Missile Systems, said that the laser-guided Maverick missile is suitable for street combat and attacking fast-moving targets. The Cub, which has been tested in actual combat, is now mounted on more than 25 types of aircraft in 33 countries. Raytheon hopes that the latest Cub missile can be exported as soon as possible.",

Because it often takes weeks or even months to wait for new parts from the Air Force maintenance base, pilots at the air wing's avionics intermediate station have begun repairing the throttle handles and front-end controls on the A-10 by themselves. At the same time, pilots also began to bypass the Air Force to install A-10 component equipment. This part of the work saved the Air Force approximately $1.3 million and improved the A-10C's mission readiness rate. Mark Berry, 188th Squadron Maintenance Group Commander, said: Without the throttle handle, the A-10 would actually be unusable, so this has a huge impact on the entire A-10 team.",

He proposed a new conceptual framework for future long-range strike capabilities and provided suggestions on how the Department of Defense should equip the long-range strike system. Specific suggestions include: launching a new Air Force plan to purchase hundreds of manned or unmanned deep penetration bombers to attack fixed and moving targets in the C4ISR system environment; developing maritime unmanned fighter jets that can implement aerial refueling, with a combat radius of at least 2778 kilometers and have strong survivability in the face of advanced air defense systems; invest in joint cruise missiles that can be launched from long-range or short-range strike platforms and can carry conventional warheads or nuclear warheads; develop a small number of conventional global conventional strike weapons that can Strike high-value targets within hours; equip airborne electronic warfare platforms to support long-range strike operations.",

Recent local conflicts have demonstrated the value of land-attack cruise missiles launched from surface ships and submarines, and their flexibility in deployment and use provides policymakers with more options, French military officials told a conference in London. To this end, the French Navy plans to purchase a naval version of an air-launched cruise missile with a range of 500 kilometers. The French multi-purpose frigates that will enter service in 2008 will replace the existing two-class surface ships. It is currently envisaged to build 17 ships, of which 9 will be land-attack types and 8 will be anti-submarine types, all of which will be capable of launching land-attack cruise ships. missile capabilities. The characteristics of these two types of frigates are that they have less than 100 crew members and a high degree of standardization and generalization. Compared with existing frigates, the cost is reduced by 30%. The ship will use the multi-mission version of the SYLVER vertical launch system, which can launch a variety of missiles. The operating cost of the new attack nuclear submarine project will be 1/3 lower than that of the Ruby class, the degree of automation will be higher, and it will only require 60 crew members. Such boats will enhance interoperability and reduce noise. The boat can also launch the French Navy's new land-attack cruise missile from a torpedo tube. As for the plan for the second aircraft carrier after the Charles de Gaulle, it is still a sensitive issue and there is no clear statement yet.",

Flowers said the new bomber will be optionally manned, based on mature technology and have long range, but could not provide further details due to confidentiality reasons. He said it was unclear whether there would be a competitive bidding process; the requested budget would be for the entire family of long-range strike systems, not just the bombers. U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Hale said on the same day that the new bomber is the core part of the long-range strike system family, and the Air Force hopes to achieve combat capability by the mid-2020s. At the same time, U.S. defense budget experts said that the Department of Defense increased the budget request for the new long-range strike system project in fiscal year 2012, indicating that the Department of Defense attaches great importance to the Air Force's new bomber project. Defense Secretary Gates said in January this year that the Air Force's new bomber project occupies a high priority in future defense investment plans.

Harry Schulte, vice president of missile systems for Raytheon Air Combat Systems, said: Raytheon is the only company to manufacture an integrated tri-modal seeker on a hot production line, and we did this less than a year after the contract was awarded. Aggressive production of the seeker in the factory has enabled Raytheon to deliver SDBII to the warfighter on schedule and at no additional cost. The SDBII seeker combines millimeter-wave radar, uncooled imaging infrared and semi-active laser sensors on a single gyro to attack fixed and moving targets at all times and in all weather conditions. The integrated seeker thus formed can achieve seamless sharing of target information between various modes, allowing the weapon to achieve round-the-clock strikes against fixed or moving targets under harsh conditions. Tom White, Raytheon's SDBII program director, said: \"Building an integrated tri-modal seeker is much more complex than simply integrating three sensors together.\" Building the fifth seeker less than a year after the Small Diameter Bomb II contract was signed proves that Raytheon is the only company with the technology to build an integrated tri-modal seeker. We are meeting estimated parts manufacturing times and allowing the program to mature so that we will realize efficiencies and cost savings when handed over to the customer.",

Port Royal. The reason why the U.S. Navy hopes to retire these seven cruisers is that the USS Cowpens, USS Anzio, USS Vicksburg, USS Gettysburg, USS Josin, and USS Hugh City have not yet undergone important combat system upgrades. As the Navy's newest guided missile cruiser, the USS Port Royal is listed because the ship ran aground on a reef in 2009 and was severely damaged. The Navy spent $24 million to repair it. However, the problems still existed after the repair was completed, so the Navy hopes to decommission the ship. No further repairs will be made. Since the 2013 defense spending bill has not yet been passed, the possibility of retiring these cruisers remains at least for now.",

The DCAM3 camera released by Hayabusa 2 captured the ejecta formed on the surface of Ryugu due to the impact, but the image from DCAM3 did not It was not shown whether an impact crater was formed after the impact on Ryugu's surface. Therefore, Hayabusa2 carried out the observation operation of the asteroid surface impact area from April 23 to 25. It began to prepare for descent on April 23, began to descend on April 24, and reached the lowest altitude of about 1,700 on April 25. After observing at this altitude for a period of time, Hayabusa2 began to rise and returned to its original position to standby. JAXA Hayabusa2 project manager Tsuda Yuichi said they confirmed the impact crater from images taken by Hayabusa2 from a distance of 1,700 meters from the asteroid's surface. JAXA posted images of the asteroid's surface before and after the SCI collision on Twitter and found that the terrain within a 20-meter-wide area on the asteroid's surface has changed.

Sealant was used to repair the underground workshop after officials learned that work to repair imperfect door welds in the underground workshop had not been completed six years after the order, according to a report by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The government temporarily suspended work on the nuclear weapons while sealant was used to repair the welds. After this, it starts running again. But on July 21, it was reported that an official and the Nuclear Facilities Safety Commission found that the sealant was peeling off. Now, safety board officials say it would cost $15 million to $20 million to seal the potential leak.

The key research facility used is an inertial confinement fusion device. Therefore, its development is not restricted by the Comprehensive Nuclear Ban Treaty and can be used as a conventional weapon in the military. . Currently, there are three types of fourth-generation nuclear weapons being studied by the United States, France, Russia and other countries: Metallic hydrogen weapons: Hydrogen can be converted into solid crystals under a certain pressure and can be maintained at room temperature for a long time without sealing. This is metallic hydrogen. . The explosive power of metallic hydrogen is equivalent to 25 to 35 times that of TNT explosive of the same mass. It is the most powerful chemical explosive currently imaginable. Nuclear isomers: Nuclear isomers are approximately one gigajoule/gram, which is 1 million times more energetic than high explosives. Nuclear isomers can be obtained through nucleosynthesis using neutron pulses generated by microexplosions in heavy ion collisions or inertial confinement fusion. Like metallic hydrogen, nuclear isomer weapons can be used as conventional weapons or as triggers for clean hydrogen bombs. Antimatter weapons: A very small amount of matter interacts with its antimatter counterpart to rapidly release huge amounts of energy, enough to compress a plutonium or uranium pellet to create a chain reaction. Just a few micrograms of antimatter can be used as a trigger for a thermonuclear explosion, or to stimulate extremely powerful X-ray or gamma-ray lasers. Antimatter is the most important type of fourth-generation nuclear weapons currently being studied. The production and research of antimatter is being carried out at the Fermi National Accelerator Institute in the United States, the European Center for Nuclear Research jointly built by France and Switzerland, and the Institute of High Energy Physics in Russia.",

The 282-foot submarine, which has been a Russian floating submarine museum since 2002, attracted tens of thousands of visitors before it sank in a storm in April 2007. The dive team had to wait for the best conditions, then inject air into the sub and gradually remove the water from inside the sub. According to the plan, the submarine, which is covered by 30-50 feet of water, will surface, and the entire process will take about 10 hours. A spokesman for the submarine salvage team said: The bow of the submarine will surface first, and then other parts will surface. Several questions remain during the salvage operation, including how much silt may be weighing down the submarine. After the submarine is salvaged and safely placed in its predetermined location, special teams will enter the submarine to ensure that there are no harmful gases inside. Once the air is determined to have been cleared, inspectors can inspect the submarine for damage. The submarine was first launched in 1965 and was incorporated into the Soviet Northern Fleet, named K-77 or Juliette 484. The submarine was the only submarine on display in the United States, and before its sinking, it was one of two on display outside the Soviet Union.",

Recently, NASA revealed that based on calculations based on available data, the probability of each Iridium fragment re-entering the atmosphere and causing harm to people on Earth is 1:18,405, and the probability of all 74 Iridium stars re-entering and causing harm to people on Earth is 1:1. 249. The study found that there are four components in the Iridium system that may burn and re-enter the atmosphere. They include a 10-kilogram titanium fuel tank, a 30-kilogram battery, a 6.3-kilogram structural bracket, and a 116-kilogram electronic control board. At the same time, NASA research shows that part of the Iridium satellite system burned when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere last year, causing satellite debris weighing 168 tons to be scattered on the Earth's surface. Fortunately, no casualties were caused. However, although the probability of the burning debris causing harm to the current population and animals on the earth is currently low, considering the substantial increase in the population of the earth in the future, the possibility of the burning debris of Iridium hitting the human body will become increasingly greater. .",

After launching more than 30 reconnaissance satellites each year in the 1970s and 1980s, Russia has rarely launched camera reconnaissance satellites in recent years. The reconnaissance satellite was launched only once in 1999 and three times in 2000. This exposed Russia's lack of financial resources and also meant that with the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Russia no longer had such satellites. From September 28, 1996 to May 15, 1997, no camera reconnaissance satellite appeared in Russian space orbit. This was the longest interruption since Russia began its reconnaissance operations in 1962. Russia currently uses four types of camera reconnaissance satellites, three of which belong to the Amber reconnaissance satellite series. The most advanced reconnaissance satellites can transmit images to the ground through radio communication signals. Their mission time depends on the amount of fuel they can carry for orbital operations. Russia's latest addition, Orlets-2Yenissey, has flown only twice in recent years. The configuration of these satellites is unknown, but it is believed that they can carry more than 20 film pods. Of the two recent satellites, it is believed that the main body of the first satellite crashed into the Pacific Ocean where all large Russian satellites including the Mir space station are buried. One of the two satellites recently returned to the ground is the Orlets-2 satellite.",

But a shortage of Army special operations pilots and aircraft has hampered plans to expand the force, which is desperately needed in the war on terror and would play a major role in a possible war in Iraq. This week, a senior Defense Department official told reporters that pilots flying special operations aircraft like the MH-47 will not be assigned to unrelated missions in the future. The Army is also reconsidering the use of special operations aviation units to conduct anti-drug trafficking missions for the U.S. Southern Command. The Army is determined to address its long-standing pilot shortage, the official said. And the Pentagon plans to increase the number of MH-47s in the next few years. Earlier this year, Army special operations commanders planned to increase the number of MH-47 aircraft to 60. However, details of the fleet expansion have not yet been disclosed. Senior Defense Department officials also said that some MH-47s will be purchased to fill the gaps of helicopters that crashed during Operation Enduring Freedom, and that for the first time, aircraft attrition reserves will be established for the special operations fleet. Strengthening aviation capabilities is an important part of the US Special Operations Command's efforts to transform its role. The command plans to significantly increase funding and manpower in the President's fiscal year 2004 budget request. This will allow the command to act as a mission commander on the battlefield rather than a support unit.",

The mission of the Prowler EA-6B is to jam and bomb the radar systems that control surface-to-air missiles. In the two weeks since the coalition's invasion of Iraq, the Ranger EA-6B has had to escape the pursuit of a missile at least once. The F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet disappeared while performing a bombing mission over Iraq on the evening of April 2. Until now, the missing persons have not been found, and the cause of the disappearance has not yet been determined. It is estimated that it may have been attacked by missiles or anti-aircraft weapons. . This danger can be mitigated by the use of joint air defense standoff weapons, which allow pilots to release bombs many kilometers away from their targets. Even in the unlikely event of being targeted and hit, the F/A-18 Hornet can continue to fly out of Iraq before ejecting or landing. The US also claimed that Iraq did not use high-precision radar guidance technology. Before performing a mission, pilots will be informed on how to face and deal with possible threats, and how to save themselves when making an emergency landing in enemy territory. Pilots also often wear life jackets, which carry a first aid system, a radio receiver for contacting rescue forces, a flashlight, and a pistol.",

In 1998, Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices in one day and a sixth two days later. According to conservative estimates, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal has approximately 150 to 180 nuclear bombs. In response to the threat of retaliatory border attacks from India, Pakistan has focused on developing tactical nuclear weapons, which have low-yield characteristics and are used to destroy military targets on the battlefield. According to a report in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Pakistan has approximately 20 to 30 transport aircraft used to carry Nasser short-range tactical nuclear ballistic missiles. Analysts believe that Pakistan will need to use at least a nuclear weapon with an explosive yield of 30 kilotons to severely damage the Indian army, but the radioactive particles produced by the explosion may kill millions of Pakistanis.",

In the first quarter of 2011, Lockheed Martin will submit NKCE's operational concept and mission planning strategy to the U.S. Air Force. Lockheed Martin stated that NKCE requires an air delivery platform that can attack multiple targets in one mission.

Admiral Silva said that we have lost our technological advantage in the hypersonic field, but we have not lost the hypersonic battle yet. China has established a national-level project and will invest huge amounts of money in the field of hypersonics to solve a series of problems related to hypersonic flight, target indication and final engagement. The U.S. Department of Defense has also launched a series of hypersonic system research and development projects, but has failed to form a synergy. Closing the kill chain will be the next step in the development of hypersonic technology: either to attack fixed targets, this kill chain is relatively easy to close; or to attack mobile targets, this kill chain is relatively difficult. The U.S. Department of Defense is also currently weighing research on the manned/unmanned issue. Setting up a manned cockpit on a hypersonic aircraft involves a series of technical issues, including size, high maneuverability, high overload and other issues. I'm not sure yet which agency would want to develop a manned hypersonic aircraft. There are currently three agencies in the Department of Defense conducting hypersonic research. Among them, DARPA is vigorously promoting hypersonic research, and the Navy also has a hypersonic project. I won\u2019t say who the third one is.",

The bombs weighed 2,000 pounds. This is the first time it has been used in actual combat. The EGBU-27 is an improved version of the GBU-27 Paveway III laser-guided bomb. Under normal circumstances, the F-117's bomb bay can hold two 2,000-pound laser-guided bombs. By fiscal year 2006, the aircraft will be able to carry JDAM bombs developed by Boeing that use combined GPS/inertial navigation guidance. Prior to this, the U.S. Air Force planned to improve 500 GBU-27s into EGBU-27s. The use of EGBU-27 at the beginning of the war shows that the U.S. Air Force has confidence in the EP3 seeker to work properly under adverse enemy conditions and avoid more collateral damage. Iraq could use smoke to jam laser-guided bombs and jamming techniques to fool GPS-guided weapons. Because EGBU-27 is equipped with two sets of guidance devices, it can effectively combat these interferences.",

The FAA said in a notice issued on March 9 that available airworthiness standards do not include adequate or appropriate safety standards for the fire safety of composite wing and fuel tank structures after a crash. The existing regulations are only for conventional aluminum alloy structures. The FAA says aluminum is highly thermally conductive and can quickly transfer heat from a ground fire to the remaining fuel in the tank. The heat capacity of aluminum and oil will delay the onset of fire and wing fracture, allowing sufficient time for personnel to evacuate. The FAA said research shows that a five-minute delay in fuselage burnout will significantly improve personnel survivability. Because carbon fiber has low thermal conductivity, the FAA said more testing and analysis must be conducted to prove that the 787 can provide adequate safety. The FAA said 787 fuel tanks must be able to withstand a fire environment for at least five minutes after a crash. According to the special conditions proposed, Boeing will require verification that safety regulations are met within the maximum to minimum fuel load range.",

Although the U.S. Navy initially required the safety system to be installed on all new and modified helicopters, the U.S. Navy later recommended cutting funding for the installation of IMDS on the H-53 and H-60. The U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense has specifically funded a five-year, $30 million IMDS research program from fiscal year 97 to fiscal year 02. If the capability and cost targets of IMDS can meet the requirements, it is hoped that the U.S. Navy can purchase this system. The U.S. Navy also plans to install this system on a total of 350 H-53 and H-60 \u200b\u200bhelicopters to improve safety and reduce overall costs as quickly as possible.",

In addition to retrofitting a new digital flight control system, the project also includes retrofitting a new crash data recording system, a data transmission system for the mission computer and upgraded software. The F-111 was originally a fighter aircraft developed and produced by General Dynamics of the United States for the United States Air Force and the Australian Air Force. It was later transferred to the Ford Worth Company in Texas for production, which is currently a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin. Since the aircraft was retired from the US Air Force in 1996, Australia has been the only user of the aircraft. Although Lockheed Martin is the original manufacturer of the F-111 fighter jet, the company recently lost out on a bid with Boeing for a contract worth at least $3 million to provide long-term technical support for the Australian Navy fleet. .",

Participants also recommended that Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan be jointly defended by the collective security treaty member states. The presidents of Tajikistan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan are currently studying this proposal, and the powerful departments of the four countries are also actively consulting on this issue. Rushailo said the participants also reached an agreement on consolidating the CIS Counter-Terrorist Center and its branch in Bishkek. He said that detecting and cutting off the financial sources of international terrorists should become the main task of the counter-terrorism center. When talking about the situation in Afghanistan, Rushailo emphasized that the CIS countries should be directly involved in building peace in Afghanistan in the future so that it can become a country that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.",

The aircraft are currently in storage at the Royal Air Force. Defense Management Website understands the deal will be concluded within the next two weeks. Some reports speculate that the United States will have to pay at least 50 million US dollars to Britain to purchase Harrier aircraft spare parts, while the cost of purchasing the Harrier aircraft itself and its Rolls-Royce MK-105 and MK-107 engines is still uncertain. The U.S. Marine Corps currently has about 120 AV-8B Harrier aircraft, including training aircraft, but these aircraft were originally planned to be phased out after the short-range and vertical take-off and landing versions of the Joint Strike Fighter F-35B entered service. The 35B is expected to enter service within five years. The Harrier vertical take-off and landing aircraft and naval aircraft carriers were abolished in the UK's 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review.

The reorganization of the project was approved by Edward Peter Aldridge, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. The management methods and funding for the new joint project have yet to be decided. The SDB serves as the main weapon of the planned Joint Strike Fighter and will be used by the USN and USMC. SDB service in either branch of the military has not yet been budgeted for next year and funding has not yet been determined. Although the USN and USMC were not the exact participants in drafting and adopting the SDB requirements, the application of the SDB to the JSF illustrates that the weapon will be suitable for joint operations. This caused the USN to issue a need for insensitive munitions, which was reflected in the operational requirements document submitted by the US Air Force. The US Air Force decided to select two winning bidding companies to sign contracts and make them responsible for the initial phase of SDB development to meet the accelerated weapons development schedule. It is difficult to predict whether the USN and USMC will be able to work on this project that has been planned by the US Air Force.",

Among them, US$84.3 million is an amendment to the AGM-154C-1 Joint Standoff Weapon fixed-price contract signed earlier with the US Navy; US$15 million is a fixed-price contract for the production of laser-guided Maverick missiles for the US Air Force. The two contracts were announced by the U.S. Department of Defense on December 19, 2011. AGM-154C-1 is equipped with a two-way data link for combating conventional weapons, adding the ability to strike at moving targets at sea. It will become the first networked air-launched anti-ship weapon in the US military inventory. This weapon will also be used for export. The new laser-guided Maverick missile, designated AGM-65E2/L, has an enhanced laser seeker and new software to reduce the risk of collateral damage. In addition to the ability to accurately strike fast-moving targets in urban environments, it can also provide laser designation for missiles through the launching aircraft itself. Earlier missile models could only be designated by another aircraft or a ground-based laser designator.",

Last year, acquisition costs for these projects increased by $74.4 billion, of which approximately $31.1 billion was due to reasons such as low production efficiency, an increase of $29.6 billion in quantity changes, and an increase of $13.7 billion in research and development costs. In 2011, the most important cost increase was caused by a few projects. Among them, the Joint Strike Fighter project not only had the largest cost increase last year, but also has the largest future funding requirements. However, there are also many projects where purchasing power has declined due to increased procurement costs. The number of projects in the report dropped from 98 to 96, with further reductions planned for the next fiscal year to reach the lowest level since 2004. The U.S. General Accounting Office evaluated the implementation of some acquisition reforms. A total of 16 future programs implemented the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, and acquisition programs also began to implement new Department of Defense programs, such as developing affordability goals and Reasonable cost analysis. In addition, these 16 future projects are planning to invest more funds in technology development.",

The improvement of the AV-8B Harrier II aircraft is to enable it to deliver precision-guided munitions under various weather conditions. The experience of the Kosovo War shows that it is very important for the aircraft to have the performance to adapt to harsh weather conditions. On the other hand, it is to further improve its safety and reliability. Currently, the Marine Corps has 71 aircraft that can fully perform various missions, while another 30 aircraft are undergoing maintenance and inspection. What's more, in October last year, 65 Harrier aircraft were unable to fly due to various maintenance. In terms of supporting shore-based and sea-based fire support systems, there are the following items: First, the 155mm XM777 howitzer will be purchased, which is part of the continuous purchase of 450 XM777 howitzers over several years; secondly, the development of new 5-inch naval guns and DD -21 advanced naval gun system and new guided artillery shells.

The senior official's comments come as the Defense Department is said to be laying the groundwork for further arms reductions in a still-secret nuclear policy. Pentagon officials said the document is nearly complete, but the White House has not yet approved its adoption or announced it publicly. The Obama administration is considered unlikely to approve any new proposals for further reductions in nuclear weapons before the November presidential election.",

The Korean Central News Agency also quoted a National Defense Commission spokesman as saying that North Korea would respond to any nuclear or missile attack by the United States or South Korea. North Korea issued the warning two days after South Korea released its contract with the United States. According to this contract, South Korea's missile range will be three times the original range, capable of covering the entire North Korean territory. The spokesperson of the North Korean National Defense Commission also said that the North Korean army with strategic rocket power can not only attack the military bases of the United States and South Korea in South Korea, but also Japan, Guam and the United States. South Korean analysts did not regard the statement as a military threat. They argue there is no evidence North Korea possesses intercontinental ballistic missiles and that a North Korean rocket launch in April was unsuccessful. It is reported that North Korea is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile called Taepodong-2, but there is no successful test record of this missile.",

The Joint Strike Missile is a derivative of the maritime strike missile that was put into service with the Norwegian Navy in October 2012. It was originally planned to be an air-launched multi-mission precision guided weapon carried by F-35 fighter jets. While maintaining the original infrared imaging seeker, GPS-assisted guidance, and maritime strike system guidance equipment packages, the air-launched version of the Joint Strike Missile has actually been redesigned to meet the needs of air launch and integration with the F-35. The main adjustments include redesigning the missile body shape, reducing the weight of the missile body, using a new turbojet engine, adjusting the air intake device, and installing new missile airfoils. Its fuel reserves can give it a range of more than 275 kilometers, and it also includes a two-way No. 16 compatible data link. Kongsberg currently plans to use joint strike missiles such as the precision-guided missile family series, and the submarine-launched version is one of the solutions being studied.",

The Amur-class Type 1650 submarine is equipped with multi-functional torpedoes and anti-ship missiles. In addition, it can also use advanced cruise missiles such as BrahMos to effectively attack land targets. The submarine can rely on the AIP system to continuously perform combat missions underwater for up to 25 days, which is 5 to 10 days longer than similar foreign submarines. AIP submarines usually use hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, which are quieter than traditional diesel-electric submarines.

Undersecretary of Defense Ashton Carter and other senior officials expressed their views on the situation of hundreds of billions of dollars in budget cuts on top of the $487 billion already planned. The Department of Defense's first cut of another $500 billion over the next decade began on March 1, which means it will be cut by $46 billion this year. Chief weapons acquisition officer Frank Kendall said some weapons programs will face termination if Congress and the Obama administration can't find a way to prevent another budget cut, but he declined to say which programs would be most at risk. Kendall said the Defense Department will protect some programs, including cyberspace security and Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, but other programs may face termination.",

The purpose is to integrate two new weapons, the US-made small diameter bomb and the AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation missile, into the Tornado fighter. The AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation missile uses a radio frequency seeker that can memorize target characteristics and location, which means it can effectively attack targets with radar shutdown. He also has the ability to target point selection, that is, he can select the weakest part of the target to attack, such as choosing to attack the radar's computer processor instead of the transmitting antenna. The positioning capability ensures that advanced anti-radiation missiles will not accidentally damage friendly forces. The missile is suitable for performing the task of suppressing enemy air defense firepower in emergency combat situations. The small-diameter bomb has been in service with the U.S. Air Force since 2006. It has a maximum range of 96 kilometers and has the ability to strike outside the zone. It can penetrate hard targets and maintain high accuracy and low collateral damage. The bomb is available in two types: GBU-39GPS/INS guided type and GBU-54 laser+GPS/INS guided type. Among them, the GBU-54 can attack mobile targets.",

The test conducted by North Korea in February 2013 included a miniaturized device and achieved greater explosive power than the previous two tests. Based on these tests, it is believed that North Korea possesses a nuclear weapon similar to the atomic bomb the United States dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.

Some military experts have previously predicted the LRS-B project, believing that the project will be manned at the beginning of service, and will eventually be determined to be optionally manned, but the US Air Force has never explained this. U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Doley said today: The development of this project will start as a manned aircraft, but there will still be an option to become an unmanned aircraft at some point in the future; I think the option to become an unmanned aircraft should be protected. The Air Force is still some way off from contract negotiations for the program, but Secretary Dooley said there won't be any major changes to the program's design or requirements. The U.S. Air Force's expected entry into service for this project is around 2025, and the expected procurement target is 80-100 aircraft. However, the cost of the project is an issue that deserves most attention. It is uncertain when the Air Force will announce the Department of Defense\u2019s procurement strategy for this project in detail, but the details of the contract are currently being evaluated. Dolly said that the Air Force is currently developing a procurement contract strategy.",

U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert said at the 2013 Singapore International Maritime and Defense Exhibition that the U.S. Navy has completed the modified design of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's vertical takeoff and landing program on the Wasp-class amphibious ship. Navy officials explained that the modification is to eliminate the pressure increase caused by the exhaust of the Joint Strike Fighter. The form and flight characteristics of the F-35 exhaust device require the protection, rearrangement or removal of vulnerable systems during flight operations, such as antennas, life rafts, safety guardrails, safety nets and JP-5 refueling stations. In addition, he also said that the unique high-heat characteristics of the F-35 require strengthening the flight deck to slow down the pressure increase caused by high-temperature jets. At the same time, the flight deck coating needs to be modified to reduce coating corrosion caused by the high pressure of the exhaust nozzle. Additionally, a new voltage regulator and rectifier will need to be installed. Since the F-35's ability to perform missions has been greatly improved, it is necessary to improve ammunition throughput and weapons handling capabilities, as well as enhance the functions of other support equipment related to carrier-based aircraft. Other relevant modification details include: Phalanx close-in defense weapon system, RAM rolling missile and NATO Sea Sparrow missile launcher, and strengthened protection of gas stations. At the same time, it is necessary to remove the WSC-8 satellite communication antenna and increase the use of aqueous film-forming foam fire extinguishing agent systems.",

In today's engagements, missile operators need to maintain sight of the target from target identification to hit. The new solution is part of the Agency Line of Sight project jointly conducted by the UK and France and is part of the innovative technology cooperation plan for missile materials and components. In proxy line-of-sight guidance mode, the missile will be able to utilize UAV-mounted imagers or other third-party equipment for line-of-sight command guidance to attack invisible targets. Current plans include two guidance options. The first option is based on current second-generation anti-tank weapons and therefore can utilize existing weapon systems. The second solution is based on fourth-generation technology that may be used in future missile systems. In both scenarios, the terminal flight of the missile is essentially the same, while different guidance methods are used during the mid-flight.",

Robert Kohler, commander of the U.S. Department of Defense Strategic Command, met with defense reporters in Washington, D.C., and stated that the U.S. nuclear deterrent will need B61 nuclear bombs in the foreseeable future and that the U.S. will protect its allies and partners. The extended deterrence strategy also requires this bomb. This bomb is not a Cold War debris. It is crucial to carry out the B61 nuclear bomb life extension project. This special project needs to be pushed forward now. Kohler said that the life extension project should be coordinated and comprehensive, which is the most cost-effective option. If only the key electronic components of the bomb are updated and other upgrades are postponed, the cost of the upgrade will eventually increase. Kohler pointed out that the B61 nuclear bomb is not only equipped with the F-15E and F-16 fighter jets of the United States in Europe, but also equipped with the B-2 stealth bomber; F-35 fighter jets are also expected to carry the bomb, and the bomb will also become a long-range strike bomber One of the nuclear weapons that can be used.",

The developments at Arak have embattled international efforts to negotiate with Iran over its suspected nuclear weapons program and raised the possibility of an Israeli attack on the Arak reactor site. The Wall Street Journal stated that the United States and Western society are mainly concerned about Iran's uranium enrichment program. As for Iran's development of plutonium, which can also be used as a material for making explosive devices, officials are surprised. The newspaper also highlighted that reactor sites like Arak are more vulnerable to attack than Iran's enrichment facilities at Natanz and Qom. Former and current U.S. officials say Israel will most likely attack Arak before Iran can deliver nuclear materials to the site to prevent large-scale environmental damage.",

President Obama has sought to limit Iran's suspected nuclear weapons capabilities through economic pressure and diplomatic engagement, while not denying the direct use of force against Tehran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also highlighted the possibility of military strikes against Iran, which insists its nuclear activities are purely peaceful. According to a report by Jorah Erland, a former Israeli national security adviser, quoted by the Hebrew website, between September and October last year, President Obama asked Netanyahu to shelve the military strike plan. Eiland said in the report that when an issue involves some interests of the United States, we cannot go against their will. Still, the former official later told The Times of Israel that the report on the Hebrew website was riddled with inaccuracies.",

According to Reuters, the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies pointed out that Pakistan and India continue to expand their nuclear capabilities... The sharp increase in the nuclear arms race in South Asia has caused greater uneasiness. According to previous reports, Pakistan's newly developed short-range nuclear missile Hataf-9 can be equipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead. The intention was clearly to target conventional incursions into Pakistani territory by Indian soldiers. At the same time, India believes that its latest BrahMos supersonic cruise missile has great advantages in a potential conflict with Pakistan. It is thought that the missile could also carry a nuclear warhead. The annual report of the International Institute for Strategic Studies pointed out that if Islamabad uses tactical nuclear weapons to repel the invasion of Indian troops, it will also have a serious negative impact on Pakistan itself. Reuters quoted the report as saying that in this scenario, some of Pakistan's densely populated agricultural heartlands would also become barren lands after a nuclear attack.",

But the U.S. defense industrial base is much smaller today than it was at the end of the Cold War. The Department of Defense is in a period of budget constraints, and the international security environment is creating new military challenges, such as denial/restriction capabilities, threats from space-based systems, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Defense has not developed a coherent, long-term strategy for maintaining the core capabilities of the defense industrial base. In the absence of such a strategy to prioritize what to maintain rather than what to cut, the likelihood that our nation's industrial base will lose critical design and manufacturing capabilities needed by the U.S. military is increasing. This report explores the areas of competition that will shape U.S. military relations with potential adversaries over the next decade or two, such as non-nuclear global precision strike, flexible and effective nuclear forces, the delivery and maintenance of sufficient joint forces to conduct operations, and access to the global commons. and maintain freedom of movement, cryptography, combat training, and the defense industrial base capabilities the United States needs to maintain advantage.",

According to shipyard sources, there are some innovations in this overhaul. For example, shipyards build tool rooms close to submarine repair docks. This approach has been used in aircraft carrier maintenance, but due to the conditions of the Norfolk shipyard, it has not been used in submarine maintenance before. Additionally, the Albany's maintenance team received additional management training.

The National Defense Authorization Act signed by U.S. President Obama in December did not set a fixed deadline, but required LRSO to establish initial operational capabilities before the retirement of its replacement weapon, the AGM-86 air-launched cruise missile. The U.S. Air Force, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, reported that it would extend the service life of B-52 bombers that launch AGM-86 until at least 2030. The missile was previously expected to be retired around 2020. The missile will equip the U.S. Air Force's Future Long-Range Strike Bomber, which is entering early stages of development through two secret programs. In October 2013, the U.S. Air Force announced that it was conducting market research to identify companies that could undertake the research and development of LRSO. In December 2012, it announced plans to award contracts to four companies: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. The U.S. Air Force officially stated that it will purchase 80 to 100 LRS-B bombers and is expected to enter service around 2025. The bomber mainly uses mature technology to reduce costs. Boeing announced in October 2013 that it would cooperate with Lockheed Martin to compete with Northrop Grumman for the LRS-B project.",

One industry official said this is indeed one area of \u200b\u200binterest for the Navy. In a typical day of air combat, at least five Super Hornets are required to perform aerial refueling for other carrier-based aircraft in the squadron. Retired Navy logistics officials said that sometimes 20 percent of a Super Hornet wing's sorties were refueling missions. In the past decade, the Navy's carrier-based Super Hornet squadrons have been heavily utilized due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and their fatigue life has been consumed rapidly under heavy load conditions. Therefore, in actual use, the Navy has been rotating Super Hornet aircraft that perform aerial refueling to balance the fatigue and loss status of the entire flying wing's carrier-based aircraft. In the future, if an aircraft carrier can only carry 6 UCLASS, these drones may have to include the special task of aerial refueling while performing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.",

A pro-Palestinian hacker activist collective reportedly attacked the websites of Israel's Ministry of Education, Postal Service, and Central Bureau of Statistics. The anonymous hacker attack first occurred in November 2012 after Israel launched a military operation in Gaza. On April 7, 2013, Israel was once again attacked by cyber attacks. On April 6, 2014, Anonymous issued a warning to Israel, calling on its members to use any necessary means to launch attacks on Israeli cyberspace. A year ago, the hacker group Anonymous launched a large-scale cyber attack on many Israeli websites. The anonymous group claimed to have invaded the websites of the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Defense, the Shin Bet and other state agencies. Additionally, the group published a list of email addresses and credit card numbers it said were taken from the website of an IDF equipment supplier. However, Israeli authorities said the attack did not cause significant damage to state or civilian internet operations. According to YouTube videos, the organization has complained against the Israeli authorities and is taking action in retaliation for Israel's crimes against humanity against Palestine.",

According to former DRDO chief VK Saraswat, India is considering the feasibility of developing anti-satellite missiles, which will take the capabilities of the Indian missile force to new heights. This will involve the development of lasers and exoatmospheric interceptors. If the Agni-III missile is integrated with the ballistic missile defense kill interceptor, then it is feasible for India to develop an anti-satellite kill device. Saraswat added that the effective range is about 1,400-1,500 kilometers, which is enough to attack satellites. India is known to have developed exoatmospheric interceptors that can be integrated with missiles to attack satellites. Recently, former DRDO chief VK Saraswat had said that there is a need for India to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to attack hostile satellites in low earth orbit and polar orbit. Although it has not been officially confirmed, India already has the propulsion system for the Agni series missiles and also has anti-personnel aircraft. According to DRDO, Indian ballistic missile defense will incorporate the development of anti-satellite weapons. India claims to develop anti-satellite weapons that can electronically or physically destroy satellites in low earth orbit and higher geosynchronous orbit. In a previous statement, Saraswat said that while research work on various components of the system is ongoing, the assembly and construction of anti-satellite weapons will only be carried out when the country needs it.",

After the first delivery of this weapon system in 2010, there were deficiencies in hit rate. The South Korean Institute of Defense Research completed its improvements in May this year. After the South Korean Navy equips the improved version of the Red Shark, it will have world-leading anti-submarine combat capabilities. . When attacking an enemy submarine, the flying red shark will open its parachute before contacting the water to reduce the impact, and release it after entering the water to attack the enemy. Generally speaking, the ultimate speed of a torpedo cannot exceed the speed of sound. The submarine determines the opponent's position through sound, but due to seawater resistance, the sound will reach the submarine before the torpedoes. The submarine can avoid the torpedo attack by running away at full speed after hearing the sound. In order to overcome this, the newly developed Red Shark launches induced bombs and flies into the sea area near enemy submarines to weaken the sound of torpedoes, thus making it more difficult for enemy submarines to distinguish. The Red Shark is composed of a vertical launch induced bomb, a vertical launch system, and a launch control system. Its thrust direction controller has significantly improved in withstanding high temperatures, and its inertial overcoming device makes the hit rate higher than that of the American VLA. The hatch below the deck can be opened and launched at any time and anywhere. This greatly improves the ship's survivability, space utilization efficiency and flexibility.",

Before the formal talks, the two also exchanged views one-on-one. After the revolution broke out in Iran in 1979, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran. Last year, the United States and its allies agreed to engage in dialogue with Iran and strive to sign a long-term agreement to end economic sanctions on Iran on the condition that Iran denuclearizes. Iran rejects Western accusations against him, which claim that Iran is secretly developing military nuclear technology under the pretext of developing civilian nuclear power. When it comes to Islamist militants, Iran is sending a series of mixed signals. A senior Iranian official expressed willingness to cooperate with the United States and its allies to prevent the activities of the Islamic State, but also said that Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program should be viewed more flexibly. Kerry publicly stated last Friday that although Islamic issues should be discussed separately from the Iranian nuclear negotiations, Iran will play an important role in fighting the Islamic State, suggesting that the U.S. policy stance is changing. U.S. President Obama has no plans to meet with Iranian President Rouhani in New York.",

Cylance said the attack, named Operation Cleaver, began two years ago and was operated by a company and hacker group disguised as a construction company in Tehran, Iran. Attackers use SQL injection, phishing, drinking water attacks and other means to steal important and confidential information and control the victim company's network. Cylance confirmed that more than 50 targets in 16 countries including the United States, South Korea, Europe, and the Middle East have been attacked. The main targets are infrastructure-related companies such as air transportation, energy, oil, natural gas, and communications, as well as government agencies and academic institutions. In addition, the networks and systems of airlines and airports in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan were also attacked. According to analysis by Cylance, the attack steals a large amount of personal information containing employee photos and work plans, airport and aviation security information, residential, communications, power distribution diagrams and other information, and its goals seem to go beyond money and intellectual property.",

    "doctext": "Reggie Ellison, chairman of the Association for the Advancement of Missile Defense, wrote in an open letter on Wednesday that the current U.S. ballistic missile defense system can be used to intercept hypersonic glide vehicles after appropriate upgrades and improvements. Current anti-missile systems use ballistic prediction algorithms to intercept ballistic missiles. But HGV breaks this logical principle through non-ballistic flight. Chairman Ellison further explained that the launch method of HGV is similar to that of ballistic missiles, but it does not enter space. Instead, it is released at high altitude and performs jumping and gliding maneuvers in the thin atmosphere, and finally hits the target. Nonetheless, the weapon can still be intercepted during a certain phase of flight. Ellison pointed out that the U.S. military's THAAD terminal high-level area anti-missile system can intercept HGVs at high altitudes before they maneuver. To do this, a boost stage is added to the THAAD system's interceptors to increase speed and range. Ellison also believes that the SM-6 missile is another system that can be used to intercept HGVs. This missile was originally designed to intercept low-flying cruise missiles. Ellison concluded by pointing out that all of these potential options should be considered, researched, screened and funding decisions made.",

Attack aircraft use the same method. He told a meeting that as a first step, the military will adopt a more open system architecture on Block 4, now defined as the first upgrade to enter service. LaPlante said there's no final decision yet, but we're going to try. This will make subsequent upgrades and improvements possible in a competitive manner. In the past, most major upgrade improvements were performed on a sole-source basis by the initial prime contractor. Budget documents show that F-35 development funds will cost more than $500 million per year after entering service. The Air Force also plans to begin competitive upgrades to information technology systems such as a distributed common ground system to process intelligence data and a common ground control station to control multiple drone types. To implement the competition, LaPlante said the Department of Defense informed industry of the direction of the upgrade program and funded research and development projects that would help competitors compete with the original prime contractors.",

Pakistan Foreign Minister Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry said his country uses low-yield tactical nuclear weapons to deal with India's so-called cold start doctrine. India has officially denied the existence of a cold start doctrine, although the military does have an aggressive strategy. If Pakistan triggers a large-scale terrorist attack, India can activate rapid conventional force attacks on the border to defend the territory until international pressure prompts a ceasefire. The Indian military wants a brief and limited war within the nuclear threshold. Pakistan's announcement of its tactical nuclear weapons has threatened India to lower its original nuclear threshold. In theory, tactical nuclear weapons are different from strategic nuclear weapons in that they are short-range and low-yield weapons, which means that they can be used in battlefield operations.",

    "doctext": "This week, the Navy's director of undersea warfare told the U.S. Naval Institute News Network that the future fleet of nuclear attack submarines will have a longer combat range and can share information without affecting stealth. Rear Admiral Charles Richard said that the attack nuclear submarine fleet represents the asymmetric advantages of the United States. Underwater operations require cooperation to maximize technological advantages and make full use of the environment. In the interview, he said how to gain an advantage on the battlefield? How to improve one's own sensing capabilities? How to have better missiles and torpedoes? These are all issues that need to be considered. In terms of weapons, Richard said the Navy is working on multiple weapons projects to increase the attack range of submarines. For example, increasing the anti-ship capability of the Tomahawk missile will benefit the surface fleet and submarine fleet. Fiscal Year 2017 also included work on innovative torpedo prototypes. The improvement of existing torpedoes is to upgrade the software and hardware of heavy-duty torpedoes through the technology rapid implantation plan. Going forward, Richard said understanding how submarines use non-kinetic strikes is his top priority. Submarines today, and even in the future, will not only carry weapons but also unmanned underwater vehicles or drones to extend their combat range. Richard said the Navy has purchased 150 3-inch drones, and about a dozen 21-inch drones will be integrated into the submarines and transmit information back to the submarines. In the submarine field, 16 21-inch offshore UUVs will also join the submarine fleet to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.",

According to the agreement, India will receive 245 Stinger air-to-air missiles, their launchers and engineering support equipment. Duane Gooden, vice president of ground combat systems at Raytheon Company, said that like other countries in the world, India considers Stinger air-to-air missiles to be an important weapon for attack helicopters and light attack helicopters to perform missions. The Stinger missile can successfully improve the aircraft's ability to complete its mission while combating real threats. In the past four major conflicts, Stinger missiles have successfully intercepted 270 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and are highly praised. Currently, 19 countries are equipped with Stinger air-to-air missiles, and all four major U.S. services have purchased and installed the missiles. The purchase of Stinger air-to-air missiles is part of a $3.1 billion contract signed between India and the United States. The purchase list of this large contract includes combat helicopters, weapons, radars and electronic warfare components. The Stinger supersonic missile has high agility, a high-precision navigation control system and a lethal warhead, making it capable of attacking various helicopters, drones, cruise missiles and fixed-wing aircraft. The Stinger missile not only has land-based and sea-based surface-to-air strike capabilities, but also has air-to-air combat capabilities and can be integrated into most fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft.",

According to the report, an audit by the Government Accountability Office found that during the 10 fiscal years from 2008 to 2018, the U.S. Navy's attack nuclear submarines were unable to enter the shipyard for maintenance in time, or were stranded at the shipyard due to maintenance delays, resulting in a cumulative total of 10,363 days. Equipment is vacant or maintenance is delayed. Take the USS Boyce nuclear submarine as an example. It was originally scheduled to go to the shipyard for life extension maintenance in 2013. However, due to the heavy workload at the shipyard, the maintenance work was delayed until 2016. As a result, the submarine was unable to operate normally and had to stay in the port for two years in vain. . And this is just the tip of the iceberg of poor maintenance of U.S. military nuclear submarines. Investigators revealed that the 14 attack nuclear submarines spent a total of 1,891 days, equivalent to 61 months, waiting to enter the factory for maintenance. If calculated according to the full life cost of the Seawolf-class nuclear submarine, every day of idling is equivalent to US$200,000 wasted.",

It explores the increasing importance of offshore operations and the proliferation of anti-ship missiles. Contextualizes the Royal Navy and Marine Corps' offshore strike concepts and provides recommendations for meeting the challenges of offshore operations. The report pointed out that offshore areas gather important economic infrastructure and population centers, so in a war with limited targets, the ability to effectively control key points in offshore areas is very important. The expanded scope of anti-access and area denial due to the combination of precision strike weapons and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance makes traditional amphibious assaults more difficult. The report recommends that current large amphibious assault ships be modified to support a scalable force capable of operating within enemy anti-access zones, reducing enemy combat capabilities and inserting follow-on forces. Currently, the British Navy and Marine Corps are exploring the future littoral combat model. The offshore assault ship program announced by former Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson is still in its early stages and plans to reposition the Marine Corps as a commando team with a mission setting similar to that of the Marine Corps. The U.S. Marine Corps is more similar.",

He said that research and development will begin as soon as possible and will be introduced in the Air Self-Defense Force in sequence. According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency report on March 20, regarding the reasons for the introduction, Iwaya pointed out that in recent years, ships from other countries have been promoting the introduction of long-range anti-aircraft firearms. He emphasized that in consideration of strengthening the defense of Japan's surrounding islands, Japan also needs to increase the range of its missiles. According to reports, long-range cruise missiles have the ability to attack ships from outside enemy range. The Japanese government plans to improve the air-to-ship missile that was developed in 2017 and is said to have a range of less than 200 kilometers, and plans to increase the range to more than 400 kilometers. Air-to-ship missiles were developed for use on F-2 fighters, but have not yet been deployed due to short range and other reasons. Iwaya said that in addition, efforts will be made to realize long-range missiles by focusing on the utilization of the follow-up models of the F-2 that are expected to be retired in the 2030s.",

EPAS technology will provide real-time surveillance and detection of submarines and other smaller targets in relatively shallow waters and is an important part of the U.S. Navy\u2019s anti-submarine warfare program. EPAS is a prototype passive electro-optical camera system housed in a 16-inch tower capable of capturing images of surface and underwater targets. The EPAS system applies four different non-acoustic detection technologies into one system, including a 12-channel visual multispectral imager, 3-channel low-spectrum detector, 3-channel low-light zoom camera and mid-wave infrared detector. BAE Systems plans to complete the work in March 2008.\u200b",

The U.S. \"Aerospace Daily\" reported on February 26, 2007 that the U.S. Air Force revealed that in the past two years, its F-22 Raptor fighter, F-35 Active electronically scanned array radars on the Joint Strike Fighter and E-8J-STAR aircraft can do more than detect small, even stealth missiles. With some modifications, these aircraft could use this radar to attack enemy air-to-air, surface-to-air and cruise missiles using false target signals or high-energy microwave pulses. This high-energy microwave pulse can damage electrical components. The U.S. Navy says it is currently exploring such technological avenues. A squadron of two-seat F/A-18F aircraft has been equipped with AESA radar for precision maritime combat missions. However, the Navy has not yet fully mastered directed energy capabilities. A senior Pentagon official said: High-energy microwave attack on cruise missiles is a technology that, whether it has been completed on the F/A-18E/F aircraft or will be carried out on the G-model aircraft, is of great significance to the requirements office. Said there is still a doubt",

The new demining device is designed to combat enemy personnel and anti-tank mines. It is based on the TMT-S demining device. The improved design makes the structure lighter and is equipped with a newly developed special coupling. Since tractors are much cheaper than tanks, demining tractors are more economically profitable than demining tanks. Necessary changes will be made in the design of the new equipment to protect the crew from fragments in the event of an explosion.

The National Academy of Sciences concluded in a report on Wednesday that 68 nuclear power plants in 31 states in the United States use deep pools to store highly radioactive spent fuel, which poses a higher risk of terrorist attacks than reactor buildings. Scientists say reinforced concrete pools are more exposed and vulnerable to attacks by suicide planes or high-performance explosives, which can set spent fuel rods on fire and release large amounts of radioactivity. Although the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission considers the potential risk of a radioactive release in this scenario to be extremely low, it still recommends that reactor operators consider redesigning their spent fuel storage pools.",

Raytheon researchers began developing a high-energy solid-state laser with a power of 4 kilowatts a year ago and increased the power to 25 kilowatts this summer. The U.S. Department of Defense will sign a contract in October this year to develop a solid-state laser with a power of 100 kilowatts for laboratory verification. The competition faced by lasers as weapons is not only to have high power, but also to have high-quality laser beams, and to be small enough to be installed on tactical aircraft and ground combat vehicles. Raytheon's solid-state laser laboratory plans to amplify existing 25-kilowatt solid-state lasers into 100-kilowatt lasers. The laser uses a phase coupling lens to correct the optical aberration generated by the laser itself and the optical aberration caused by the atmosphere between the launch platform and the target, so that after miniaturization, the laser can be used both in aircraft and on the move. A heavy-duty truck or trailer can be launched directly at the target, or it can direct the laser beam emitted by the platform to the target to be attacked through a computer-controlled relay lens mounted on a tethered balloon or unmanned helicopter.",

Despite its superior technology and Instalaza's steadily improving reputation, Aloctan-100 still faces a situation where the international market has been flooded and the domestic market is limited. Ongoing combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have highlighted the increased need for lightweight, shoulder-fired weapons for infantrymen to effectively engage a variety of targets. The Aloctan-100 and related weapons should be particularly suitable to fill this need. However, we cannot confirm whether the Spanish army uses the Aloctan-100 weapon system in combat. Without operational validation to promote today's international markets, Aloctan-100 would still be at a significant disadvantage in the market. In fact, there is no evidence that Aloctan-100 has ever been exported. Both export orders and follow-up orders for the Spanish army at a medium level are likely to recover this year.

According to the plan, advanced short-range air-to-air missiles will be installed on the third batch of F-35s in 2012, and Storm Shadow and Brimstone missiles will be installed on the fourth batch of F-35s in 2015. However, the funding for the latter two items has not yet been implemented. , Storm Shadow will be the heaviest missile installed on the F-35 and requires the development of a special external pylon.

It has published revised requirements for the target to the industry on its website and hopes that the industry will add new additions to it. The request will be reviewed and promptly provided to Naval Air Systems Command with a deadline of December 1. The Naval Air Target and Decoy Systems Office of the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command issued a request for information on the target missile in February this year, saying it was used for training and support of ship defense systems including Aegis and DD destroyers. Russia's Threat D anti-ship missile is a dual-section, two-stage attack weapon that flies to the target at subsonic speed, and then projects the small supersonic missile it carries to attack it when it approaches the target. The U.S. Naval Air Systems Command plans to start soliciting bids in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. After making the decision to enter Milestone B at the beginning of fiscal year 2007, it will sign a development contract with the winning company as soon as possible, and plans to start putting it into use by the end of fiscal year 2010. The target missile is an aircraft running at full speed. It can be launched from the ground or in the air. The flight distance is about 185 kilometers. The cruising speed is M number 0.6 to 0.8. The flight speed of its supersonic small missile is M number 2.2 to 3.5.",

But LRSO is the unique ability of the United States to deter enemies from using nuclear power when protecting the security of the US military. Updating the LRSO ensures that the United States maintains a credible and reliable strategic deterrent. Standoff cruise missiles refer to strategic missiles that are launched from bombers located outside the enemy's air defense area and penetrate the enemy's airspace to strike protected targets. This missile is mainly equipped with the non-stealth bomber B-52. Opponents believe that after the B-2 and B-21 stealth bombers enter service, the B-52 and LRSO are redundant, and the LRSO cruise missile does not give warning before launching, which can easily cause misunderstandings by the enemy and trigger a devastating counterattack. Danger. However, the deployment of stealth bombers will have to wait 20 years, existing B-52s will be in service until the 2040s, and modern cruise missiles will not undermine safety. The new LRSOs will be equipped with stealth capabilities, giving the United States the ability to intervene in highly defended areas. In addition, maintenance of LRSOs will also be easier and cheaper thanks to the application of modern components. Gen. David Goldfein, the next commander of the U.S. Air Force, has stated before Congress that LRSOs are essential and supports the president's commitment to maintain a credible and effective nuclear strike force level in the triad.",

Korotchenko said that the prototype referred to here is an experimental prototype, and its operating principle is based on the interaction of microwave pulses against hostile targets, aiming to paralyze enemy radio equipment, resulting in a large-scale loss of its combat functions. He also added that if it meets the relevant requirements of the Ministry of National Defense, the prototype can be further improved to meet the established requirements and be fielded in the future. Experts point out that the use of this system is the most promising way to paralyze enemy tactical unmanned systems directly on the battlefield. This weapon and equipment can hit targets 1 kilometer away. According to him, many foreign countries are actively developing such weapons and equipment based on this attack principle, especially the United States.",

Work to restore joint radar stations around Russia was completed at the end of 2016, but the radar stations that monitor missile activity in the Arctic Circle are still not in use. The Russian missile attack early warning system mainly consists of three parts: space satellites that monitor missile launches, ground-based early warning radar systems that can calculate missile trajectories, and radar stations in the Moscow area that can detect, track ballistic missiles, and guide interceptor missiles. Since 2008, Russia has begun building a joint air defense and anti-missile system. The system is not only designed to integrate Russia's own air defense and anti-missile systems, but can also be integrated with the systems of other CIS countries. In fact, the construction of this system indicates that the boundaries between tactical and strategic air and missile defense systems are gradually disappearing. The concept of the joint system involves a multi-layered, multi-angle air defense and anti-missile system, which has the ability to effectively deal with air targets of different ranges and heights.",

Speaking to reporters, Bogdan mentioned the possibility of adding a third missile to each side. This upgrade activity will be part of the fourth batch of F-35 capability upgrades, but as far as I know, this is something that all services and participating partners are looking forward to. Bogdan said that increasing the load capacity does not require the development of a special version of the AMRAAM missile. It is the same AMRAAM we use now, just one more; it may be installed on the weapons bay door. Currently, the F-35 can carry two AMRAAM missiles in each side weapons bay, or a mix of AMRAAM and Joint Direct Attack Munitions. Bogda warned that a lot of work needs to be done, and he did not give a specific time for such upgrades.",

The contract originated from an agreement reached during the Norwegian Defense Minister's visit to Australia in 2015. JSM is Norway's new generation of long-range precision strike missile, which will be integrated into the embedded cabin of the F-35 fighter jet. The missile can fly at low altitudes along the terrain and uses advanced materials and advanced passive seekers, which makes detection and interception by current advanced air defense systems extremely difficult. BAE Systems Australia will develop an advanced radio frequency seeker for the JSM, which will enable the JSM to lock on to targets based on their electronic signature. This will further enhance JSM's strike capabilities in current complex combat scenarios.",

The official said: Although the discussion has not yet ended, the commanders of the Navy and Marine Corps have confirmed the plan. In March of this year, an internal Navy research report revealed to the outside world that the Navy was considering integrating the F-35 Purchases of strike fighters were reduced from 1,089 to 680, and purchases of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets were reduced from 548 to 460. Navy and Marine Corps officials are planning to integrate tactical air forces. According to the senior Navy official, the integration plan may have been prompted by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's statement that the military's capabilities must be consistent with the budget. But he said the integration plan would not reduce the navy's strike capabilities because fewer aircraft would fly more sorties under the plan. He said: The factor that determines attack power is not how many fighter jets there are on a platform, but how many aircraft sorties there are every day. If sorties could be increased, we wouldn't need a lot of aircraft.",

He said: To this end, we have made significant investments in production lines. But at a press conference on July 12, Pentagon officials warned the U.S. Department of Defense that these production lines would be shut down if Congress did not approve an additional $14 billion in fiscal year 2002 funding before the August recess. U.S. Navy officials have identified a need to increase the inventory of weapons and equipment for future wars, especially JDAM, as the current inventory is already very small.

After receiving President Bush's letter requesting funding on July 3, the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee plans to implement the $10 billion in combat readiness funds on July 18, and is expected to increase funding for JDAM and Hellfire missiles.

In an interview with the media, Erdogan said that he had proposed a proposal to jointly produce the S-500 air defense system to Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is not the first time Erdogan has proposed joint production of the S-500 air defense and anti-missile system. Earlier, in October 2017, Erdogan told the media that the two countries were negotiating on the production of S-500 air and missile defense systems. The S-500 air defense and missile defense system produced by Almaz-Antey Group has not yet been installed in the Russian Armed Forces. In February this year, the then Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said in an interview with the Daily Mirror that Nizhny Novgorod was producing truck-pulled S-500 and S-400 systems. According to the Russian Satellite Network, the S-500 air defense and anti-missile system, which constitutes the high-altitude layer of Russia's layered air defense system, is expected to be able to attack targets at an altitude of more than 60 miles, surpassing all existing missile defense systems. The system will be able to detect and simultaneously engage up to 10 ballistic missile warheads traveling at speeds exceeding 4 miles per second. Its unique self-seeking warhead can search for targets and find them. The S-500 system is also the only missile defense system capable of striking hypersonic targets.",

New evidence, including satellite photos, shows the missiles, which are liquid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missiles, are being built at a factory that produced North Korea's first missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. The new intelligence does not indicate that North Korea has improved its missile development capabilities, but rather that it has continued to work on advanced weapons in the weeks since the U.S.-North Korea talks. While operations at the Samnong-dong nuclear power plant are said to be continuing, work has stopped at the Sohae Satellite Launch Station on North Korea's northwest coast and workers can be seen dismantling engine test stands. Many analysts and independent experts believe the dismantling was largely symbolic and that the test bed could easily be rebuilt within months. At last month's Singapore summit, Kim Jong Un agreed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, but the document signed with Trump did not detail how and when North Korea would achieve denuclearization. After the summit, Trump tweeted that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat. The U.S. Secretary of State said last week that North Korea was still producing fuel for its nuclear bombs despite its pledge to give up its nuclear program. Ongoing talks with North Korea are verifiable evidence of denuclearization, saying Kim understands the U.S. definition of denuclearization and that North Korea is not taking advantage of the Trump administration.",

The report showed that FC/ASW is in the interests of the United Kingdom and France. The FC/ASW project aims to develop a new generation of deep strike and anti-ship missiles for use in the 2030s to replace the Harpoon, Exocet and Storm Precursor/Skarp missiles. In 2017, the British and French governments agreed that MBDA would carry out the concept phase of the project, which will end in 2020, after which the two countries will decide whether to enter the design, development and production phases. The joint report noted that while the conceptual phase of the project is progressing well, several key issues still need to be resolved to allow the project to continue beyond 2020. One of the main issues is how the UK will deal with the heavy anti-ship missile capability gap caused by the retirement of the Harpoon anti-ship missile in 2023. In addition, Britain and France have differences in prioritizing stealth and high speed. The United Kingdom focuses more on stealth, while France focuses more on speed. Being able to reach agreement on this issue is also a key factor in the success of the FC/ASW project. Although the report pointed out the above problems, it still emphasized that the FC/ASW project has sufficient time to eliminate differences, and both Britain and France believe that these problems can be resolved amicably and successfully.",

The award of the third batch production contract is another important milestone for the Air Force/Raytheon AGM-65H/K team. It will allow the group to continue research efforts to achieve the Air Force's goal of developing an infrared and television composite guided Maverick missile. Additionally, the Air Force awarded Raytheon a $7.5 million fixed-price contract to produce 200 AGM-65H, 25 AGM-65K and 75 CATM-65K training missiles. The Maverick utilizes charge-coupled device sensors to improve the missile's performance at low altitudes. The CCD sensor also supports the Maverick missile's new electro-optical guidance component, allowing the missile to strike targets from a distance 2 to 4 times the range of earlier AGM-65A/B variants. The guidance and control section will be placed in the center of the rear of the missile warhead. The AGM-65H missile carries a hollow charge warhead weighing 60kg, and the AGM-65K warhead carries a 134.3kg penetration/fragmentation warhead, equipped with an optional delay fuze. Major work on the contract will be performed at Raytheon facilities. Contract options should be finalized by December 2004.",

The statement came in response to General Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has strongly pushed for modifications of Trident missile warheads to be able to carry low-yield nuclear weapons. Selva believes that if Russia decides to attack the United States with low-yield nuclear weapons, the United States will be in trouble. The United States' principle is to respond with low-yield nuclear weapons. But without low-yield nuclear weapons in its inventory, the United States would have to respond with higher-yield nuclear weapons. Presumably, this would trigger an all-out nuclear war. The Russian Foreign Ministry blasted Selva's statement, calling it dishonest and pointing out that the use of low-yield nuclear weapons is not even part of Russia's military doctrine. Russia insists it has nothing to do with U.S. attempts to turn nuclear weapons into battlefield weapons. The United States does not seem to mind using low-yield nuclear warheads as a means of threatening dissident countries.",

Rashid Ahmed claimed that Pakistan possesses mini-nuclear bombs of 125 to 250 grams, which can hit and destroy targets according to Pakistan's ideas. He also warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to avoid war lest it become the final battle between the two nuclear-armed countries. Rashid Ahmed said dialogue is possible if India takes steps to resolve the Kashmir issue in compliance with UN resolutions. If India launches a war against Pakistan, Pakistan will crush India.",

Timothy Ray said, \"We believe that in the long term, we will consider using air-breathing cruise missiles, but... we are very satisfied with the Air Force's choice of hypersonic weapons options.\" In addition, Timothy Ray revealed that the Air Force is looking to improve the B-1 bomber to add an external hardpoint device that can carry 6 air-launched rapid response weapons. Although the U.S. Air Force did not request funding for this improvement in its fiscal year 2021 budget proposal, Timothy Ray confirmed to the Air Force Magazine website that his team is formulating relevant plans.",

The main impetus for implementing this plan is to modernize the United States' overburdened air traffic management system. In the area of \u200b\u200bsafety, NASA plans to accelerate the development of technology that does not allow pilots to crash controllable aircraft. \"We are trying to develop an operating system that makes it impossible for anyone to use commercial aircraft as weapons to attack us again,\" the NASA official said. This system is called the non-collision system. At the last critical moment when the aircraft is about to impact, it can remove the aircraft from the pilot's control and allow the aircraft to fly to a safe altitude. This technology was mentioned in NASA's recent aviation development plan. The FAA says such systems can even allow aircraft to land automatically. However, although NASA officials believe that these technologies can be used in the near future, in fact, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to establish the parameters for use. The U.S. Senate is now considering requiring the FAA and NASA to develop a development plan that will meet the long-term safety and management capabilities of the U.S. air traffic management system.",

It is difficult for existing sensors and missile defense interceptors to reach this area to intercept. In response to this issue, Michael White, director of hypersonics at the U.S. Department of Defense, said that the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s hypersonic air defense and missile defense systems will be designed to conduct defensive operations in nearby space. Hypersonic weapons fly fast and can fly at an altitude of 24 kilometers to 46 kilometers. In most cases, they can hit the target within a few minutes. Therefore, the longest window for intercepting hypersonic weapons is not when the hypersonic weapon ascends. Or the descent phase, but spend most of the flight at near space altitude. Hypersonic weapon defense in near space may benefit from advanced high-speed sensors and AI algorithms that can complete detection within milliseconds to guide missile interceptors and weapons to impact and destroy. Satellite sensors are also increasingly used to track hypersonic weapons and serve as guidance nodes for missile interceptors.",

Japan will improve the Type 12 surface-to-ship missile so that it can be launched from ships and aircraft and attack ground targets. The bill will pass a cabinet vote next week. The range of the new Type 12 missile will be extended from the current more than 100 kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. It is stealth and can attack from outside the range of enemy missiles. It can be used to attack enemy missile bases in the future. The Ministry of Defense will include 33.5 billion yen in related funds in next year's budget to repeatedly carry out improvements such as enlarging the aircraft and adding main wings, and complete the development work within five years.",

If the plan is confirmed, the land attack missile will most likely be launched from a torpedo tube. The main purpose of Spain's construction of the S-80 is to replace the current S-50 submarine. The S-80 submarine is very similar to the Crab-class submarines built by Izar Shipyard and France's DCN Company for the Chilean Navy and the Malaysian Navy. In order to make the newly built submarines have more advanced performance, Spain will use an AIP system similar to the Stirling engine used by the Swedish A-19 submarine, or the fuel cell system used by the German U-212 submarine. Although the Crab submarine design can be adapted to any AIP system, if it is equipped with a vertical missile launcher capable of launching land attack missiles, its hull must be enlarged.",

This type of UAV can be carried by high-speed landing craft and special ships. It is 1.21 meters long, 0.95 meters wide, and 0.165 meters high. It has a speed of 80-130 kilometers per hour, can last for 30 minutes, and has a payload of 3 kilograms. After launch, the drone can loiter in the air and detect targets, and can conduct dive attacks along a vertical trajectory. This allows it to attack tanks on the battlefield from above and penetrate the weakly protected turrets on the upper armor of the tanks. Ordinary air defense systems face difficulties when fighting this type of advanced drones.",

This is the first specialized strategic command established by India to manage its nuclear weapons system after it entered the threshold of a nuclear power. In the statement, Indian officials also reiterated the principle of no first use of nuclear weapons. The institution consists of a political committee and an administrative committee, with Prime Minister Vajpayee as chairman of the political committee. The statement emphasized that the Political Committee of the Nuclear Weapons Command is the only body with the authority to approve the use of nuclear weapons. When talking about India's nuclear policy, the statement reiterated that India will retain the possibility of using nuclear weapons and launching a large-scale retaliatory nuclear strike if India's territory and armed forces are first attacked by nuclear weapons. The Indian government has also pledged not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states. But if non-nuclear countries launch biological and chemical warfare, India will reserve the right to carry out nuclear strikes. According to Agence France-Presse, analysts believe that the goal of India's decision is to establish an organizational structure for its strike capabilities and thereby pose a threat to Pakistan. This organizational structure will also help India to respond quickly when it faces a nuclear, biological, or chemical attack to avoid chaos.",

Arkin believes that the use of nuclear weapons against Iraq is already under consideration by the US military. He said: Nuclear weapons have been part of the discussion among war planners from day one. But the Bush administration's plan to use nuclear weapons preemptively means that the threshold for using nuclear weapons has been greatly lowered. U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld signed a secret nuclear program assessment report in December 2001, opening the door to the use of nuclear weapons against countries that could withstand non-nuclear weapons strikes, and including Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya and Syria was put on the list of possible targets for attack. According to Arkin, the assessment report also calls on the military to study plans for attacking foreign weapons of mass destruction facilities, even if the enemy does not use such weapons first. The work is currently underway at U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Nebraska, and the military has prepared a nuclear planning document for Iraq as an option for the Bush administration to invade the country.",

    "doctext": "Modern surveillance and reconnaissance systems that perform high-risk missions and transmit large amounts of data in real time are phasing out manned systems in favor of surveillance and reconnaissance systems and unmanned systems, largely due to their relatively low cost and ability to conserve valuable human resources. . Driving SR technology advancements is the need for interoperability among equipment used by multiple agencies that are shrinking in size as defense spending shrinks. The government is willing to invest in advanced platforms with better intelligence-gathering capabilities. Improvements in imaging and radio frequency systems will help meet the requirements of complex communications systems. Among them, communication systems collect, analyze, archive and forward information to enhance situational awareness. The use of drones equipped with multiple sensors and hovering at vantage points will reduce the deficit because they can reduce the availability of manned aircraft and reduce the cost of support personnel and related training. At the same time, drones can also conduct reconnaissance in areas contaminated by nuclear and sublimation attacks, thereby reducing personnel risks. A report revealed that the industry generated a total revenue of $4.6 billion in 2002. Total market revenue is expected to reach US$4.9 billion in 2008. Component costs are reduced due to the use of advanced civilian off-the-shelf technology. Therefore, although developing countries lack market capacity, resources and system integration capabilities, SR technology is spreading from developed countries to these countries.",

For years, Canada has been undecided about whether to participate in the U.S. national missile defense program, but now it has made it clear that it will discuss the project with the United States. Canada is considering supporting the project mainly because the international situation has changed. The project is no longer considered an interstellar warfare project, but a project to defend homeland security against missile attacks. Considering geographical factors, Canada is willing to negotiate with the United States on this project. But Canada still opposes the weaponization of space. Canada's Foreign Minister said: We only discuss ballistic missile defense with the United States because this is the key to guiding ground-based interceptor missiles. The United States has always hoped to integrate the command and control system of the Canadian-U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command into ground-based interceptor missiles, and hopes that the national missile defense project will have initial capabilities by the end of 2004.",

Sheldon, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed that the U.S. military used computer systems to attack Yugoslavia during the 11-week air campaign, but he declined to disclose further details. It is estimated that the US military may have used its own computers to sabotage Yugoslavia's air defense computer system. This is the first time the United States has admitted to using computer tactics against other countries in war. Shelton told reporters: I can say that we used part of the computer system and the actions we took at that time were offensive. However, it is not convenient for me to disclose specifically what actions were taken at that time. I remember that during the Balkan War, Yugoslavia\u2019s computer network and Internet were temporarily paralyzed, cutting the country off from the outside world. Analysts say computer tactics have become a new generation of tactics. Sheldon also said that the U.S. Department of Defense is also very concerned about preventing its military computers from being invaded by enemies. It not only needs to prevent ordinary hackers from intruding and causing damage, but also to prevent enemy intrusions when war breaks out.",

French President Chirac is expected to approve the new principle in the near future. France's original principles for the use of nuclear weapons took into account a nuclear force that was independent of the United States and deterred the former Soviet Union's power in Europe. But by the early 1990s, this principle was clearly outdated due to changes in the global strategic geography. The use of nuclear weapons in a first strike during the Cold War was supposed to show France's determination to strike large cities in the former Soviet Union. Now its purpose is to determine national interests. It is within the President's authority to determine the scope and limits of this interest. The new strategy also includes countries that are developing their own nuclear weapons and other countries that violate international treaties and develop weapons of mass destruction as nuclear targets for France to attack. The French nuclear force was established in 1960 and began to assume combat duty in 1964. There are now three components: land-based, sea-based and space-based nuclear forces. France has a total of 4 strategic nuclear submarines, each equipped with 16 intercontinental ballistic missiles.",

In the first phase of the system, the U.S. Air Force's Air Transport Command's C-17 and C-130 large transport aircraft were equipped with the system for testing. The system, code-named AN/AAQ-24IR, was developed by Northrop Grumman. It is an improved version of the directional infrared interference system currently used on special operations aircraft. Both are used to prevent large-scale Transport aircraft are not vulnerable to shoulder-launched infrared missiles. In the second phase of the system, technology updates will be implemented through a spiral acquisition strategy to increase the availability and effectiveness required by Air Transport Command. One of these technical updates is the adoption of a next-generation missile warning system to increase the probability of the LAIRCM system detecting enemy missiles. In addition, it also includes technical updates to improve the compatibility of the LAIRCM system to ensure that it is equipped with the Air Transport Command's C-17 Compatibility with the LAIRCM system on the C-130 large transport aircraft and similar systems on MC-130E/H, AC-130H/U, CV-22 and MH-53 aircraft equipped with Special Operations Command.",

The system, called the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System, will consist of ground-based and spaceborne sensors, information processing networks and a reporting system. Total RAIDRS spending will reach $210 million by fiscal 2009, and the first BlockI components will be materialized sometime in fiscal 2008. Military space commanders are enthusiastic about this defensive space capability because currently, if a satellite stops working, all possibilities must be studied to find out why the satellite stopped working. According to Daniel P. River, deputy commander of the U.S. Air Force Space Command, this move also shows a more active military space posture of the United States. He said: The top priority of the United States in space control is space situational awareness... There are three main parts: space situational awareness, defensive space confrontation and offensive space confrontation. We need to know not only what's in space, but what's happening in space, what it means, and who might be doing it. We need to continually ensure the required sensing capabilities and the ability to protect space assets.",

According to US Navy officials, the project will take shape within the next 12-18 months. It is said that the US Navy's CG will adopt a scaled hull design based on DD. Of course, the displacement of CG will be much larger than that of DD. The commander of the US Navy's surface forces said that the hull and main mechanical systems of the CG cruiser will be 80% similar to the DD. The specific size of the CG cruiser will ultimately be determined by the size of the radar. According to initial estimates, each CG cruiser must be able to carry a 5.1-6.4m antenna array, with each radar having 10,000-15,000 active elements.",

In his speech, Bush talked for the first time about the transfer of nuclear technology by Qadir Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, to Libya, Iran and North Korea, revealed the inside story of Qadir Khan's establishment of an underground nuclear smuggling network, and expressed his disapproval of Pakistani President Musharraf's expressed appreciation for its stance on combating nuclear smuggling. Bush proposed reforming the operation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and reiterated his call for the Security Council to pass a new resolution requiring member states to take stricter measures to combat illegal weapons proliferation activities such as black market trading. Media analysts here believe that Bush's speech does not have much maneuverability. The New York Times wrote an article pointing out that Bush is obviously practicing double standards again. While he called on other countries to control the proliferation of nuclear technology and equipment, he continued to encourage the Ministry of Defense to develop projects to develop small earth-penetrating nuclear weapons. At the same time, in his speech, he also clearly opposed the revision initiative proposed by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ElBaradei. The initiative calls for the creation of an international organization to regulate the production and use of nuclear fuel rods in all countries.",

Senior officials at the Office of Naval Research cited areas of research primarily designed to meet near- and long-term goals for the Navy and the U.S. military. Offshore surface ships, known as X-boats, are the main project of recent research. The main feature of this type of boats is that they can reach a speed of 50 knots in relatively harsh sea areas. The boat is currently in the experimental testing phase, but by 2006, the Navy expects to have a basic idea of \u200b\u200bthe personnel the boat can deploy. The patrol boat is an ideal platform for training new naval crews on offshore patrol boats. To help position troops on the battlefield, the Office of Naval Research is working on a small tactical unmanned vehicle, the Silver Fox, which weighs 24 pounds and is expected to be worth thousands of dollars and can stay in the air for 20 hours. The project will need to be demonstrated by the Naval Air Systems Command before being applied. In the future, the Office of Naval Research will also invest in electronic laser weapons and naval electromagnetic guns. After investing $1 billion in the electromagnetic gun project, the Navy will also research and develop weapons that can fire on moving targets at sea beyond 200 nautical miles.",

The new missile has similar performance to the Joint Standoff Air-to-Surface Missile and can be installed in the internal weapons bay of both stealth fighters. The JASSM missile developed by Lockheed Martin is a large stealth standoff air-to-surface missile with a range of more than 371 kilometers. It may be troublesome if installed in the internal weapons bays of F/A-22 and F-35. Although the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can also mount JASSM missiles externally, the U.S. Air Force requires these two stealth fighters to have as many internal weapons as possible so as not to affect the stealth performance and thereby limit the observation capabilities of enemy radars. Currently, the U.S. Air Force is studying the possibility of developing a joint dual-mission air control missile. The missile can not only be used as a standoff air-to-surface missile, but also has certain air-to-air attack capabilities that existing air-to-air missiles have. The U.S. Air Force's research on the JDRADM missile is in its early stages, and it will take a few years to decide whether to include it in the development plan.

The House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee rejected the request. The subcommittee also rejected the funding last year, but the full House and Senate later voted to reinstate the program. The government says it has no current plans to develop nuclear weapons. But it does not want to close the door to the development of bunker-busting nuclear weapons, saying it needs to use nuclear weapons with less than half the yield of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima to attack underground facilities and smaller weapons of enemy countries. Critics point out that the development of such nuclear weapons will trigger a new round of arms race and produce unimaginable consequences. In last month's vote to authorize the defense program, the White House narrowly defeated a Democratic amendment to halt nuclear weapons research. The Senate hopes to take up a Democratic defense authorization amendment next week that would then include funding for energy, water and nuclear weapons programs.",

Polish government officials confirmed that negotiations with Washington have been ongoing for eight months, indicating that Poland is willing to participate in a missile defense program that can protect the United States and its allies from long-range ballistic missile attacks. Senior government officials in Prague also confirmed that negotiations to build an advanced U.S. radar station in the Czech Republic are on track as part of a missile defense plan. A spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that we are very willing to become a specific part of the missile defense plan. We have been discussing with the United States since the end of last year. Other sources from Warsaw said that Pentagon officials have begun reconnaissance of the mountains of southern Poland, identifying two or three suitable locations for radar stations for the Star Wars Sons program. In addition to the radar station, Poland said it also wanted to build a missile interception station. According to the Bush administration's plan, two missile interception stations will be established in the United States, one in California and the other in Alaska. The missile interception station in Poland will be the only missile interception station in Europe outside the United States. Negotiations are currently in the exploratory stage and no decision has been made yet.",

It uses network protocols to quickly network multiple nodes in the air or on the ground, such as attack aircraft and command centers, to form a more superior and flexible targeting system than systems connected by hardware lines. It is used to target those that are traditionally difficult to attack, such as Mobile missile launchers conduct rapid attacks. The tactical targeting network technology was successfully tested during a recent Joint Expeditionary Force trial, using a T-39 aircraft to simulate a future fighter attack on a Scud mobile missile launcher, in addition to the onboard radio system acting as a network node. , two cameras operated by aircrew are also installed on the nose of the aircraft, which can transmit the captured images to the ground, and can also capture images according to instructions from the ground control center. The aircraft can also be networked with the Air Force's electronic systems center, the C-135 aircraft, and its operator can control the camera to capture images. This tactical targeting network technology can employ any type of network protocol and can emulate up to 1,000 nodes. The technology can also be used in programs such as the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System, automated aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles, the Joint Unmanned Air Combat System, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System/Joint Tactical Radio System and weapons data links.",

Much of the U.S. government and industry efforts have focused on developing countermeasures that could deflect man-portable heat-seeking missiles. Now experts are beginning to study the vulnerabilities of large aircraft and find ways to overcome them and improve their chances of survival. The military has a wealth of data on the impact of man-portable heat-seeking missiles hitting fighter jets and helicopters, and now larger aircraft are starting to get attention, too. This year the Pentagon's Joint Live Fire Program and the Air Force will launch a multi-year large turbofan engine test program that will study damage to CF-6 engines from attacks by portable heat-seeking missiles. The results will be used to develop requirements for future large engine design and evaluation. At the same time, NASA has also begun research on potential technologies to make aircraft more maneuverable after being attacked by portable heat-seeking missiles. Of particular interest is the use of adaptive control systems that would allow pilots to take control of the aircraft and land the damaged aircraft. The technologies being studied include fault detection and isolation systems, control reconstruction and abnormal state correction mechanism research. NASA also hopes to conduct research on how lightweight structures can better withstand the effects of explosions and fires, and may conduct scaled-down and full-scale structural tests.",

The small island of Shemea disappears into the cold waters of the Bering Sea. Its steep landmass is only 7 kilometers long and 3 kilometers wide. The Pentagon has selected it as the site for the world's largest radar station within the National Missile and Antimissile Program. Shemiya Island is a long and narrow island, only 400 kilometers away from Russia\u2019s Comandor Islands and 700 kilometers away from the coast of Kamchatka. It is the best place to respond quickly to missiles launched from the mainland by North Korea, China and Russia. And the radar station is not only used to monitor missile launches, but can also control anti-missile launches from Alaska. For the 80 experts who came to Alaska to prepare, Shemea was the scariest place in the world. Blizzards and storms are normal weather. Despite this, scientists and military personnel still believe that they are inclined to build a super defense system here that can protect the United States from missile strikes. If everything goes as Washington imagines, the Shemiya radar station will start working in five years.",

GAO said the uncertainty surrounding the JSF program makes it difficult to estimate the size of the financial resources needed, in part because major customers such as the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps have not decided how many aircraft they will buy. DoD should not invest in increasing production capacity until an executable program is established. The U.S. Department of Defense partially agrees with this, but the GAO report states that the Department of Defense is confident that its current management measures and processes are correct and can achieve our recommended goals. For the E-10A, GAO believes that the Department of Defense should provide a complete project acquisition plan before it enters the system development and verification stage, and should allow sufficient time to test the prototype before it is put into production. GAO also said in the report that the Department of Defense said it is adjusting the program to demonstrate key technologies on a prototype aircraft before the SDD phase begins. But based on a recent relevant report from the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense, GAO still has doubts about the maturity of the E-10A technology.",

But Rice did not specify whether the so-called choice was to impose sanctions through the United Nations Security Council, take military action or engage in bilateral dialogue with North Korea. Rice said: If there is a problem with North Korea and it continues down that path, then the United States, Japan, South Korea, China, Russia and all other countries will have to face the resulting burden. Rice also said that when the next round of six-party talks will be held mainly depends on North Korea. And once again emphasized that the United States has no intention to attack North Korea. According to a report by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency on March 22, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Ariely stressed that resuming the Six-Party Talks is the primary goal when discussing other plans for North Korea mentioned by Rice on the 21st local time. Ariely said: Our primary goal is to resume the Six-Party Talks, and our current focus is on bringing North Korea back to the Six-Party Talks. At the same time, Ariely also said: It is not yet possible to talk about what may happen.",

The United States currently has 64 nuclear power plants and 103 nuclear power reactors. All spent fuel is now stored in storage pools after being removed from reactors. The spent fuel will eventually be transported to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal site in Nevada for final disposal. Due to delays in the construction of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal site, nuclear power plant owners can only remove some spent fuel that has been stored in storage pools for a period of time and store it in huge barrels made of metal or metal and concrete. Currently, about 25 nuclear power plants in the United States use this method of dry storage of spent fuel. The Washington Post reported on March 28 that in a confidential report, a panel of experts from the National Academy of Sciences criticized the U.S. government\u2019s policy of allowing large amounts of spent fuel to be stored in storage pools.

It has a significant impact on the world market of trainer aircraft. Analysts believe that although the U.S. Air Force has been unwilling to reduce its purchase of F/A-22s, and has worked hard to lobby the Department of Defense and congressional authorities, and has included the matter in the ongoing quadrennial defense review, according to the current government Deciding to implement a strategy of budget reduction for major projects, the F/A-22 project seems to be doomed. The best outcome may be to retain the purchase of 200 to 220 aircraft. Analysts also believe that the F-35 Joint Attack Aircraft project may also be affected. However, if the aircraft can meet performance goals and cost targets, the F-35 will become the leader in the world fighter market from 2010 to 2020.",

A report from the U.S. General Accounting Office pointed out that the United States has spent a huge amount of US$3.8 billion to improve the self-defense capabilities of ships against cruise missile attacks, and plans to invest another US$5.1 billion in the next six years. However, it is still difficult to protect the fleet from cruise missile attacks. The report concluded that most U.S. ships have only limited capabilities against cruise missiles. The Navy's 1998 assessment of current surface ship self-defense capabilities concluded that none of the Navy's planned future improvements would provide any ship with a high degree of self-defense capability against long-range missile threats. The report said the Navy has not defined a comprehensive and consistent strategy for improving ship self-defense capabilities. The previous plan did not include all affected ship classes, did not prioritize ship classes, did not establish a baseline against which to measure progress, and did not specify a timeline for achieving required improvements. The GAO concluded that although Navy leaders were deeply concerned about the vulnerability of surface ships, these concerns were not reflected in ship self-defense plans. From fiscal year 1997 to 2005, funding expenditures did not change significantly, and R&D funding dropped from US$517 million to US$218 million.",

In March 2005, Phil spoke at the 2005 Future Artillery Annual Conference in London, saying that technologies in the fields of pulse energy and capacitors have matured, but a large number of land applications are still needed. Therefore, pulse alternators emerged as the preferred low-cost solution. The U.S. Navy is studying what Phil calls an important ultra-long-range artillery science and technology project. Its main research topics include artillery life and high-overload-resistant guidance, navigation and control capabilities. If this project is successful, the electromagnetic gun will achieve overwhelming lethality while significantly improving survivability and logistics capabilities. The University of Texas Advanced Technology Institute has designed common low-cost artillery projectile concepts to use railgun launchers for Navy surface fire support and Army off-line attack. The bullet has a flight mass of 15 kilograms and can carry multiple energy arrow-shaped bullets or a small number of tungsten core armor-piercing bullets. In naval applications, the projectile has a muzzle kinetic energy of 64 megajoules; a muzzle velocity of 2,500 meters per second; a maximum range of more than 500 kilometers, and an impact speed of 1,600 meters per second. In ground applications, the projectile's muzzle kinetic energy is 20 megajoules; its muzzle velocity is 1,400 meters per second, and its impact speed over a range of 100 kilometers is 700 meters per second.",

Whether it is high-energy microwave weapons or laser weapons, they have the potential to be used as non-lethal weapons. Attacking electro-optical sensors with laser weapons will soon become a reality, but there are still technical challenges, such as target identification and classification, as well as the need to solve the target tracking problem to ensure that the laser beam has enough time to stay on the target. It must be ensured that no damage is caused to human eyes. Considering that the radio frequency output of high-energy microwave weapons is attenuated, it is unrealistic to require a long range of action. The initial model will require the carrier platform to fly over the target to carry out the attack. Further discussion and decision are needed as to what type of high-energy microwave weapon to use, whether it is omnidirectional or directional.",

If the US forces us, this technology could be put to use. Russia strongly opposes the United States' attempt to revise the anti-ballistic missile treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972. The treaty prohibits the United States and Russia from building national defense systems that can protect against missile attacks. The United States currently plans to build a small defense system that can protect against attacks by small numbers of nuclear missiles such as those launched by North Korea and Iran. The United States believes that the system cannot intercept a large-scale missile attack such as that launched by Russia. Russia has no money to build a similar system. Russia said that this move would lead to a new round of arms race. The deputy defense minister said: If the United States violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Russia can defend itself by improving the performance of its weapons and equipment. He believes that improving the accuracy of launch systems is much more likely than improving the interception capabilities of anti-missile systems.",

The system can defend against possible attacks from North Korea, but Tokyo believes that this amount is too high. Washington estimates that the United States spent about $545 million on this high-tech defense program during the fiscal year 2006-2011, and therefore requires Japan to bear the same cost. However, Japan already plans to negotiate deep cost cuts with the United States, just as Tokyo has been trying to cut defense spending amid a mix of economic-oriented signals. Japan's Defense Agency did not confirm the report but said talks were continuing. A spokesman for the Defense Agency said: Japanese and U.S. officials are currently engaged in discussions on cost sharing and other issues in moving the program from joint research to the development stage, but to no avail. By March 2006, Japan will conduct a seven-year joint study of missile defense systems with the United States, spending a total of 26.2 billion yen. Japan has been eager to work with the United States to build a missile defense system since North Korea shocked the world by launching a missile in 1998.",

From a technical point of view, it only took Japan three months to develop a nuclear bomb. However, the organization also stated that due to a series of internal and external factors, even if North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, Japan will not develop nuclear weapons. The International Crisis Group said in the report: Japan's nuclear sensitivity remains a constraint in the nuclear development process, but its influence is gradually weakening. Many nuclear experts believe that because Japan has the technology and raw materials for nuclear development, Japan can build a nuclear bomb in a very short time as long as the Tokyo government is determined. The report specifically revealed that Japan currently has stockpiled more than 5 tons of plutonium*, which can produce at least hundreds of nuclear bombs.",

U.S. Air Force leaders established the Electronic Warfare Life Cycle Management Group to establish a unified approach to research, develop, and evaluate electronic warfare hardware, software, skills, and capabilities. Over the years, the Air Force's electronic warfare has been gradually heating up, and the management group will become the leader in integrating electronic warfare. Before the Governing Body was formed, there was no mechanism to integrate corporate ideas with how the Air Force conducted electronic warfare. The management team's goal is to identify commonalities among various weapons systems and standardize interfaces between electronic warfare programs. The Air Force currently cannot transfer combat capabilities across multiple platforms. There are four echelons in the management team structure, covering all electronic warfare agencies of the Air Force. The first echelon - the Senior Advisory Group, composed of the General Committee and senior administrative members, is the think tank of the entire management team. The second echelon, the technical advisory group, is an advisory and supervisory body composed of lieutenant colonels and senior civilian members. The last two echelons include the electronic warfare product group director and the system and technology evaluation research and development group. The management team will find ways to use funds more efficiently and eliminate simple duplication of work and assembly line processing. This move may be the largest change in the Air Force's electronic warfare in the next 30 years.",

The United States stopped producing plutonium-238 after shutting down the last production reactor at the Savannah River complex in the mid-1990s. Merely utilizing the original inventory and Russian-supplied plutonium-238 is far from meeting the requirements of NASA's space missions. The Bush administration plans to use existing reactors at the Idaho National Laboratory to produce 11 pounds of plutonium-238 per year for 35 years, starting in 2010. But in a report to the government on Monday, Idaho is calling on the Bush administration to develop a plan to move high-level waste from the Idaho National Laboratory to an out-of-state disposal site. Idaho also asked the Department of Energy to allow it to conduct independent monitoring of air releases and work sites at the $300 million manufacturing facility. In addition, some Idaho residents oppose the plutonium production plan because they worry that the plan will increase cancer deaths, threaten the nearby Yellowstone ecosystem, and turn the area into a potential target for terrorist attacks. Plutonium-238 cannot be used in weapons systems. Plutonium-238 can steadily and continuously release heat through a decay reaction. This heat can be used to generate electricity for spacecraft in places where solar energy cannot be used. Plutonium-238 is much more radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium-239, and ingesting a small piece can be fatal.",

    "doctext": "The Japanese Self-Defense Forces deliberately use military terminology that is different from internationally accepted military terminology. First of all, regarding the titles of military ranks, the current self-defense force generals are only divided into two levels: general and general. The rank of junior officers is divided into first, second and third levels. The rank of lieutenant is also divided into first lieutenant, second lieutenant and third lieutenant. It is surprising that It is impossible to understand the relationship between official titles at all levels. Second, the Self-Defense Forces organization is called the Staff Supervision Department, and the commonly used title of Chief of Staff is replaced by Chief of Staff. The three Self-Defense Forces of the Army, Navy, and Air Force have so-called operational classes. The operational classes are actually combat classes, but they deliberately avoid using the word \"combat\" to reduce their aggressiveness. Third, regarding the Maritime Self-Defense Force, they call themselves self-defense ships even though they are warships. They use the name frigate instead of the usual name of destroyer to cover up the fact that Japan\u2019s largest frigate has a draft of 7,000 tons and has advanced functions. In addition, the landing ship being called a transport ship is not also disguising Japan's landing combat capabilities. Fourth, in terms of the Air Self-Defense Force, the advanced F-1 and F-15 are called self-defense support aircraft, but generally they are called attack fighters or fighter-bombers internationally. Finally, the camouflage combat uniforms worn by the troops during exercises or operations are actually called work uniforms by the Self-Defense Forces.",

Experts are studying high-energy microwave weapons that generate powerful electromagnetic beam energy through explosions and electromagnetic emissions. These high-energy microwave weapons will be designed to be installed in the body of the 2,270-kilogram GBU-28 aerial bomb. As early as the 1991 Gulf War, the barrel of a 203mm caliber mortar was used as a projectile, and a high-energy microwave ground-penetrating bomb was developed and put into the battlefield for the first time to attack the strong and deeply buried commands in Iraq. mechanism. This early high-energy microwave ground-penetrating bomb was later redesigned into the 2,270-kilogram GBU-28 ground-penetrating bomb with better aerodynamic shape and stronger penetration capabilities. In the war in Afghanistan, high-energy microwave bombs once again attracted the military's interest. They used the powerful pulses they produced to penetrate rocks and cement structures, destroying electronic communications and computer equipment in enemy headquarters in caves and tunnels. However, this Bombs cannot destroy the structure of the enemy headquarters itself. The U.S. Air Force has been developing conventional bombs called giant earth-penetrating bombs, which weigh about 13,600 kilograms and are used to destroy targets buried deep underground.",

The DMLGB will be produced at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Systems. The project will upgrade the Navy's inventory of Paveway II bombs by replacing the existing computer control group system with an INS/GPS all-weather guidance system with dual-mode guidance capabilities. Incorporating proven technology, the DMLGB weapon system allows the driver greater flexibility. By upgrading existing Paveway II weapons, the time for weapon production and qualification review is shortened to meet the urgent needs of pilots. With the ability to carry out standoff precision strikes in all-weather environments, the DMLGB minimizes collateral damage and improves the efficiency of completing missions. The bomb is based on an existing civilian refurbishment program and upgrades the Navy's existing Paveway II laser-guided bomb inventory ammunition, which uses civilian components to transform the LGB into a dual-mode configuration.",

Henry said the four main themes of the QDR are: the importance of having an adaptable force; the military's ability to take early action to prevent problems from turning into crises and conflicts; joint efforts across the services and allied forces; and balancing military capabilities. The QDR is scheduled to be submitted to the U.S. Congress on February 6 next year. Initial reports on QDR suggest that the F/A-22 program has escaped major cuts, and that the Joint Strike Fighter program has also evaded attempts to cancel the Air Force version. Henry said that QDR may, but does not necessarily, specifically mention a specific project, but QDR can easily link relevant conclusions to specific projects. Henry said that the overall defense budget for fiscal year 2007 is still planned to increase, but some projects will be cut.

Lockheed Martin and Marsh were both interviewed and introduced their respective bidding plans in detail. Although Boeing accepted was interviewed but did not comment, while Raytheon declined to be interviewed by the reporter. The purpose of the U.S. Air Force's so-called innovative precision-guided ground attack weapon bidding competition is to meet the needs of tactical drones to carry out precise ground attack missions, and to use innovative weapon concepts to design guided bombs specifically for tactical drones. and missiles, which are required to weigh no more than 45.4 kilograms and can be used by active drones such as the US Air Force's MQ-1, MQ-9 Predator and the US Army's MQ-5 Hunter equipment.",

In the 2007 fiscal year defense budget request submitted by the U.S. Department of Defense, the joint unmanned air combat system project jointly conducted by the U.S. Air Force and Navy was cancelled. The U.S. Air Force turned to research on future long-range attack and reconnaissance systems, which can fly faster than J-UCAS and have a larger payload capacity; the U.S. Navy applied for a naval unmanned fighter jet project to complete its goals in the J-UCAS project: development The demand for a carrier-based UCAV the size of a tactical fighter may be 125 to 150 aircraft. Seeley said: \"We started to join forces, but for some reason, we never successfully completed the joint projects, and there were very few successful cases.\" We spent a lot of money moving forward on a joint project, and then we walked away at the last minute. This is a pure waste of money. But he also said that joint projects are also possible to succeed, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project may be a good example. He emphasized that the key to unity is the possibility of unity. If you can get what you want through it, then join forces; if not, then there is no point in starting it and then parting ways in the end.",

Rice hopes that once the United States participates in the nuclear negotiation process with Iran, it will play an important role in promoting the negotiations. Rice said in the conversation that during the Vienna nuclear negotiations, the international community will ensure that Iran has sufficient rights and interests, but Iran must terminate its uranium enrichment activities and wait for confirmation from relevant agencies. Rice said that if Iran does not terminate its nuclear program, the United States and its allies will impose stricter sanctions on it. She said that Iran must become a responsible country and not a leader in supporting terrorism. When asked whether the United States had plans to use force to strike Iran, Rice said the Bush administration had not put the topic on its agenda. Rice said the United States is not currently considering establishing full diplomatic relations with Iran.

Although the Department of Defense has terminated the project, disagreements over what existing precision air-to-ground weapons should be used to replace the JCM and enter service in 2008 have given the project a glimmer of hope. The Joint Universal Missile was originally intended to replace the Hellfire missile used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, and the AGM-65 Maverick missile used by the Navy and Marine Corps. The three services planned to order 54,000 missiles. In May 2004, Lockheed Martin won a four-year development and verification contract for the missile, and it is expected to enter service in 2009. On June 30, 2005, the Joint General Missile completed the system-level initial design qualification and conducted a controlled test missile launch three days before the qualification. The missile can carry out ground attacks from outside the defense zone. The maximum launch distance for rotorcraft is 16km and the maximum launch distance for fixed-wing aircraft is 28km. Another feature of the missile is the use of semi-active laser, infrared imaging and millimeter-wave radar 3-mode guidance methods, thus having the ability to fire and forget under various conditions. In addition, the bomb uses a tandem warhead. The shaped charge at the front can penetrate armor, while the blasting warhead at the rear can effectively kill a variety of targets.",

According to the negotiations reached during the Indian Chief of Naval Staff's visit to Russia in June, the Indian Navy urgently needs to equip six 877EKM Sindukosh-class submarines with Klub-S missiles. The Novat missile will complement the range shortcomings of the BrahMos medium-range anti-ship missile. In addition, at the end of June, the Russian Akula-class nuclear-powered submarine Napa completed the final preparations before sea trials. The submarine will join the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Alliance Navy in 2007. According to multiple sources, the submarine began construction as early as 1986 and was stopped due to the economic crisis after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Its construction is currently being resumed for lease to India. In early July, Russia and India simultaneously denied the rumor. Russia stated that Russia and India were indeed discussing the issue of leasing submarines, but they would not involve nuclear-powered submarines.",

Independent defense analysts in London pointed out that the latest submarines not only have a first-strike capability, but will also give Israel a decisive second-strike capability. It is currently believed that Israel will achieve such a strike through the Jericho-1 and Jericho-2 nuclear ballistic missiles, because they are hidden very deep underground and can avoid nuclear strikes.

All these rounds are loaded using a hydraulic automatic loader at the rear of the vehicle. Armor fragmentation and shotgun shells give Stryker units the ability to fight in urban areas. The armor-breaking round can create a breach in a reinforced concrete wall, continue to penetrate the target, and attack surrounding buildings. Shotguns can be used to kill people.

Some media reported that this move is likely to anger North Korea and regard such a visit as a military provocation that undermines nuclear disarmament dialogue. The visit of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier strike group to South Korea follows the visit of senior US nuclear negotiator Christopher Hill to North Korea last week. Hill's visit to North Korea is an attempt to salvage collapsing aid-for-disarmament talks and to dissuade North Korea from restarting its Yongbyon nuclear plant. The aircraft carrier strike group has been moored outside the port of Busan in southern South Korea. It will enter the port on Tuesday and will leave on Friday. In July this year, the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group also visited South Korea. North Korea said that while conducting diplomatic dialogue on nuclear disarmament, the United States deliberately worsened the situation. Pyongyang has not commented on the USS George Washington aircraft carrier strike group visiting South Korea. In recent weeks, North Korea has taken preliminary steps to restore its Yongbyon nuclear plant.",

    "doctext": "Russian defense analysts recently warned that Moscow reserves the right to use tactical nuclear weapons to attack missile defense systems that the United States may establish in Eastern Europe, because the missile defense systems here may threaten Russia's strategic missile forces. Alexander Pikayev, director of the research office of the Russian Institute of World Economics and International Affairs, said that according to Russia's military theory, Russia has the right to carry out preventive strikes against any target that threatens the country, and tactical nuclear weapons are one of the means that can be used to carry out strikes. The United States has stated that it hopes to establish a missile defense system in Eastern Europe aimed at intercepting missiles launched by Iran. IMEMO scholars analyze that in fact, the main goal of building a missile defense system here is to shoot down Russia's long-range missiles and destroy Russia's nuclear deterrent. A senior researcher at IMEMO said that by gradually approaching Russia's borders, the United States is achieving their main goal: to intercept Russian strategic missiles in the early stages of launch, which is the stage when the missiles are most vulnerable to attack. According to reports, Russia may adopt other means to protect its strategic missiles, including moving missile silos to the east and equipping a missile with more warheads to make interception more difficult.",

Ivanov said that unfortunately, the current development and supply status of aviation strike weapons for the Air Force cannot be called satisfactory. The development cycle of new aviation weapons is still behind schedule. It is obvious that without modern and competitive weapons and without modern and ultra-modern aircraft, military aviation cannot survive and cannot complete its combat missions. Ivanov said that the required new weapons and aviation weapons modified within the framework of the national weapons and equipment development plan have been installed in all units, and pilots should immediately get hold of aircraft equipped with modern weapons. Ivanov emphasized that the draft national weapons and equipment development plan before 2015 and the draft national budget for 2007 have already made plans for research and development funds for aviation weapons.

There are reports that the United States is considering lifting financial sanctions on North Korea. In September 2005, the U.S. Department of the Treasury banned U.S. financial institutions from conducting transactions with Banco Delta Asia, accusing the latter of being an important channel for North Korea to counterfeit U.S. dollars and launder money. The United States froze North Korea's $24 million account at the bank in the hope of cutting off North Korea's access to the international banking system. According to Japan's \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" report, however, the U.S. Treasury Department is now considering unfreezing $13 million of them, believing that they are not related to illegal financial activities. The Yomiuri Shimbun quoted sources from the U.S. Congress as saying that the U.S. Treasury Department made this response after receiving pressure from the State Department. The U.S. State Department hopes to make progress in the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue. North Korea has always maintained that its financial activities are legal and has made the lifting of sanctions a prerequisite for its return to the six-party talks. According to reports, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a statement on the 26th saying that Glaser, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, will discuss the U.S. financial sanctions against North Korea with relevant North Korean officials in Beijing on January 30. Glaser will discuss with North Korean officials the international community's concerns about North Korea's alleged illicit financial practices, as well as financial measures taken by the United States to combat illicit financial flows, the statement said.",

John Wilcox, JCTD project director of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said that the JCTD project has just been approved by Congress and will implement the first verification test within the next two months. One example of this concept is using a coastal radar surveillance and targeting system to direct a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, freshly launched from a B-1 bomber, to a target. Wilcox said the technology will expand the targeting process to enable locking of moving targets. But this capability will require breakthroughs in operational concepts and reliable intelligence. Future weapons such as small diameter bombs will also be able to communicate in flight after installing data links.",

This year's plan was approved by the Secretary of the Navy on February 2. Although this year's plan does not change the number of submarines, aircraft carriers and other types of ships required, the 2008 plan increased the long-term surface warship construction rate. The new plan shows that from 2025, three ships per year will be built instead of the previous two ships per year. According to the Navy, these surface ships include the DDG destroyer under design to replace the current DDG51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. But the number of expeditionary warships will decline, to 30 in 2015. The number of auxiliary ships was also reduced, and the number of attack submarines was slightly reduced. In the 2008 program, there were no replacement plans for the newly modified SSGN cruise missile submarine.",

Phased array radars can do more than detect small, even stealth missiles. With some modifications, these aircraft could use this radar to attack enemy air-to-air, surface-to-air and cruise missiles using false target signals or high-energy microwave pulses. This high-energy microwave pulse can damage electrical components. The U.S. Navy says it is currently exploring such technological avenues. A squadron of two-seat F/A-18F aircraft has been equipped with AESA radar for precision maritime combat missions. However, the Navy has not yet fully mastered directed energy capabilities. A senior Pentagon official said: High-energy microwave attack on cruise missiles is a technology that, whether it has been completed on the F/A-18E/F aircraft or will be carried out on the G-model aircraft, is of great significance to the requirements office.

Under a 34-month, $12.1 million Air Force Research Laboratory project, a contractor will optimize a short takeoff and landing transport aircraft design concept and conduct wind tunnel testing to verify the design's low-speed and transonic performance. . The contract is scheduled to be awarded in January 2008, and verification work is scheduled to be completed in 2010. AFRL is also conducting other research projects related to the STOL transport aircraft, including verification of integrated propulsion, lift and control, advanced composite airframe and efficient cruise exceeding M0.8. The basic requirements of the STOL transport aircraft are: the operating radius carrying a nominal load of 29.5 tons is at least 920 kilometers; the landing and take-off distance at high temperatures and high altitudes when undertaking missions is less than 610 meters, with a target of 460 meters; the ideal cargo compartment width reaches 4 meters , the same concept as the Airbus A400M and the US Army Joint Heavy Lift Aircraft. AFRL said it is seeking a multi-mission transport/attack/tanker aircraft that can utilize short airstrips and carry heavier FCS vehicles while providing the speed, stealth and survivability capabilities needed to defend against threats.",

Some military officials believe space assets should be strengthened and even weaponized to deal with anti-satellite weapons. But some within the Air Force believe a better approach would be to provide early warning of anti-satellite weapon launches and use rapid bombing strikes to eliminate launch missions before launch. Hilton believes that threats should be fought in a smooth manner, and attacks on satellites do not necessarily require space-based counterattacks. Many defense officials and Pentagon observers have been calling for a comprehensive approach to address the problem, and the need is urgent. Hilton's approach is to enhance space situational awareness, which means being better informed about what's going on in space. Hilton also emphasized that countering anti-satellite threats is not just a satellite issue. This problem has three sides, including satellites, ground stations, and links linking combatants. Potential adversaries could also target ground stations or systems that relay satellite data to troops, rendering space-based systems useless, he noted.",

Their conversations demonstrated their recognition that new threats exist in the post-Cold War era and that theater missile defense systems are needed to counter them. I think these conversations are encouraging. When I meet Mr. Putin, I will find out from him the true intent of these conversations. Although we haven't confirmed a meeting yet, I will arrange it. The proposal to establish a non-strategic missile defense system in Europe was first proposed by Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev on the 20th. The proposal elaborates on the significance and main stages of establishing this system: the first stage is to establish an expert group to assess whether there is a threat of non-strategic missile strikes against European countries; the second stage is to formulate a plan to prevent such threats; Phase three begins with the establishment of a missile defense system.",

The plan to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets was formulated by Australia's previous government, and the newly elected Labor government was prepared to cancel the plan. However, according to Joel Fitzgibbon, after evaluating Australia's air combat capabilities, the government believes that the Super Hornet fighter jet can meet the needs of the Australian military. At the same time, this aircraft is also the only aircraft that can replace the current F-111 fighter jets before 2010. However, the new Australian government finally decided to continue implementing the plan. In addition, Fitzgibbon is also worried that canceling the subscription contract will result in fines and will also affect the relationship between the parties involved in the contract. In addition to ordering new F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, the Australian Air Force's current F/A-18 combat aircraft will continue to serve until 2015, and will later be replaced by the F-35 Thunderbolt developed by the American Lockheed Martin Company.

The technology development contract comes with a two-year pre-system design and development plan, and Lockheed Martin was selected as the sole supplier. The F/A-18E/F infrared search and track system is a passive infrared sensor system that enables long-range detection and efficient weapons tracking of enemy targets in normal electronic attack environments. The system increases the survivability and lethality of air defense missions, both offensively and defensively. Relying on IRST sensor systems, warfighters can overcome electronic attacks and maintain unknown situations while detecting, identifying and engaging enemy targets across extended ranges. The high angular accuracy of the IRST system significantly increases the number of raiding individuals and target accuracy at maximum range. This information can be used alone or fused with other sensor data to further enhance situational awareness. Lockheed Martin is the only US manufacturer of IRST sensor systems. The development and production of the F/A-18E/FIRST system opens up domestic and international markets for Lockheed Martin. The IRST system is suitable for installation on a variety of platforms.",

This preliminary design is the first of three phases of ONR's Innovative Naval Prototype program, which is worth more than $150 million. According to Michael DelCheccolo, vice president of engineering for Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems Division, free electron lasers use superconducting electron accelerators to generate high-power laser beams. In the future, this high-power laser could be used to deliver instantaneous strikes against long-distance targets, which would enhance the U.S. Navy's ability to combat enemies and threats at sea. To develop this cutting-edge technology, Raytheon is running its OpenAIR business model, collaborating with DOE laboratory experts, industry and academia across the country.",

After the integration and qualification work is completed, the joint strike missile will be internally mounted on the F-35 fighter aircraft. The joint strike missile is a new missile developed on the basis of the naval strike missile. The manufacturer is producing naval strike missiles for the Norwegian and Polish navies. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense signed a first-stage development contract for the Joint Strike Missile with Kongsberg in April 2009. The newly reached agreement is a continuation of the \"Joint Sales Agreement\" signed in 2007. The signing of the \"Joint Sales Agreement\" eventually led to the signing of a development contract for the Joint Strike Missile project, and led to the U.S. government's final decision to list the Joint Strike Missile as one of the future candidate air-to-surface weapons for the F-35 fighter jet. The Joint Strike Missile weighs 1,000 pounds, has stealth performance and high maneuverability, and can strike at sea and ground targets. The missile is equipped with a GPS/INS guidance system, a unique infrared imaging seeker, and adopts a data link and automatic target recognition algorithm that can work in flight, with a range of more than 150 nautical miles. The newly signed agreement will combine the respective strengths of Lockheed Martin and Kongsberg to develop and sell new products to bring benefits to warfighters.",

The F-35 fighter jet has been listed as a priority model to meet Norway's next-generation fighter needs. The JSM missile development program will draw on many technologies and experiences derived from naval strike missiles. Norway began a few years ago to define the requirements for precision-guided strike missiles capable of completing anti-ship and land attack missions. The Norwegian Defense Research Institute and the Armed Forces jointly undertook the work of defining the requirements and drawing up a concept for the missile's operational use. Kongsberg is further studying the possibility of modifying the original Naval Strike Missile to meet possible future needs. According to the contract requirements, the development cycle of JSM is 18 months. Kongsberg also stated that the risk reduction research and technology demonstrations they conducted in the development of JSM also laid the foundation for introducing these new functions into the NSM missile. .",

Currently, the Turkish army has a serious shortage of AH-1 attack helicopters, with its total number reduced from 12 to 6 due to combat losses and malfunctions. In early 2008, the United States did not accept Turkey's request to purchase AH-1W helicopters. The reason for the rejection was that it did not have the supplementary capacity to produce this type of helicopter. Turkish defense analysts believe that the main reason for the US rejection is that the Turkish Ministry of Defense selected the Italian company AgustaWestland in the tender to purchase reconnaissance-attack helicopters for the Turkish army. The Turkish delegation plans to evaluate the price and supply time of Mi-28 helicopters during its visit to Russia. According to media reports, Turkey and Rosoboronexport began preliminary discussions on the purchase of Mi-28 helicopters at the end of 2008.",

Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso questioned calls for nuclear-weapon states not to use their strategic nuclear arsenals except in retaliation for a nuclear attack, saying: \"I wonder whether this approach can ensure Japan's security.\" Katsu Okada, secretary-general of Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic Party, said he believes the United States should implement a no-first-use nuclear weapons policy. Comments pointed out that the claim that Japan should possess nuclear weapons if Washington reduces the number or mission of US nuclear forces is simply nonsense. The commentary said that Japan's political leaders are wise on the issue that developing nuclear weapons will cause Japan to lose huge national interests. There will be no political party in Japan that supports the idea of \u200b\u200bacquiring nuclear weapons.",

For example,  U.S. Marines  approached the building where the key figures were located at  2 a.m. . Behind the building was a maze of paths, so  dispatched  a  drone  to hover behind the building. As  Marines  entered the front of the building, a Marine sergeant gave the order to clear the target. In this case, the  drone  fires a laser to identify the target, and the F-16 fighter jet launches a missile to destroy the target.  Drones  are controlled in real time from Nellis Air Force Base, 7,000 miles away, in an expeditionary operation. In an attack involving real-time information exchange, the person controlling the  drone  cannot see the target at all and is not even in the country. This is something I have never experienced before, and this method of combat is very different from the previous methods. Another difference is that thanks to advances in technology, lessons learned in combat can be summarized and applied to future battles more quickly through the Internet. Experience and lessons accumulated on the battlefield can be directly transmitted to military academies through information sharing. More importantly, empirical data can often be transmitted directly to theater platforms, allowing military personnel in theater and in the United States to quickly utilize this information.",

    "doctext": "In order to improve its combat and control capabilities in coastal waters,  the U.S. Navy  began to develop a small ship that can complete anti-submarine, air defense, and counter anti-ship cruise missile attacks in shallow waters, and can flexibly switch mission roles. This kind of boat has high stealth and good affordability, and can be deployed in large numbers. Its basic combat technical indicators are: a maximum speed of 38 knots, a minimum range of 3,000 nautical miles, the ability to carry 190 tons of frame components, and the ability to sail in sea state level 6. The ship is actually a combination of two boats. There is one in the front, called the  Combat Craft , which tows a so-called grid deployment module boat 20 feet behind using a semi-fixed tow system. The hull structure of the two boats is the same, both are wave-piercing catamaran hulls. This type of boat has the advantages of good seaworthiness, low resistance when sailing at high speed, shallow draft and large deck area. The  combat boat   in the front is equipped with  sensors  ,  electronic countermeasures  ,  anti-ship and anti-aircraft weapon systems , as well as compartments to accommodate Special Forces soldiers; the grille deployment module boat at the rear has space for nine half-size sensor or weapons modules. A half-size module space measures 18 feet wide, 11 feet long and 9 feet deep. These modules are arranged longitudinally along the centerline of the boat and can carry vertical missile launch systems, fuel, special forces equipment, etc. When carrying the fuel module, fuel can be replenished to the forward boat through the umbilical cord to increase the range. In addition, the rear boat can also be equipped with a generator or decoy launching system. In times of crisis, a false target can be formed by abandoning the rear boat to protect the submarine.",

The MV7 all-terrain vehicle is based on the civilian Polaris Athlete 700 vehicle chassis, with a reinforced steel frame and floor, front and rear adaptive winches, auxiliary fuel tanks and dual tow hooks and run-flat tires. New front and rear cargo racks can carry 68kg and 136kg respectively, and have built-in restraint anchors to carry a variety of loads. The vehicle has an unladen weight of 450 kg, while the civilian Athlete 700 has an unladen weight of 347 kg. Vehicles delivered to  Australia  are fitted with roll bars and rifle mounts. Based on the standard configuration of the improved Polaris 6\u00d76 all-terrain vehicle, a flat-panel multi-purpose cargo carrier constructed of aluminum checkered plates has been developed. The cargo bracket measures 1.2 meters x 1.2 meters, can secure cargo at multiple points, and can be tipped over to empty the cargo quickly. There are three brackets on the bottom of the carriage that operate the full width to protect loaded weapons, ammunition and essential equipment. In addition to the armrest and front cargo carrier capable of carrying 50kg, the rear carrier can safely transport 350kg of cargo over rough terrain.",

The system provides secure voice and data communications and has automatic positioning capabilities unmatched by competitive radio systems. It enables small units to achieve digital voice communications, which means an increase in capabilities for armored forces. Regarding the deployment of the Archer system, Reed said that providing communication services for Iraq's Challenger 2 tanks and Warrior infantry fighting vehicles marked a substantial step forward for the Archer project. The system has previously been deployed in Iraq for use by troops from the 12th Mechanized Brigade, and feedback reports have been encouraging. However, this will be the first time it is equipped with Challenger 2 tanks and Samurai infantry fighting vehicles.  The 7th Armored Brigade  will receive the Archer system when it  deploys  to  Iraq  this fall. The brigade will equip all armored vehicles with the Archer system, allowing commanders to easily know the location of subordinate units and allowing units to communicate and exchange data through confidential and reliable communications.",

Defense Department officials say  Trident missiles  armed with conventional warheads will provide the United States with a non-nuclear force option if necessary.  The Pentagon  will begin  fielding  the missile in  2008  . A senior Defense Department official said the prompt global strike capability is necessary to deal with situations such as terrorism, underground military facilities and rapidly growing threats that are not suitable for the use of nuclear weapons. He also added that such weapons would have a stronger ability to penetrate the earth than other conventional weapons and could serve as an alternative to the controversial powerful earth-penetrating nuclear bombs. The official acknowledged, however, that other countries could misinterpret such a long-range conventional missile attack as a nuclear strike. Nuclear experts say this situation is the same as the two types of  Trident missiles  that U.S. submarines can be equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads.",

The equipment includes a satellite communications hub and two satellite COTM systems, both mounted on mine-resistant and ambush-resistant vehicles. The COTM systems include an antenna capable of establishing a satellite communications link with the vehicle traveling at 80 miles per hour. The solution also includes a compact device that integrates land mobile radio and satellite communications with a push-to-talk interface, giving users cross-band capabilities to take advantage of both communications links. Vehicles equipped with satellite and land mobile radio communications serve as communications hubs, providing an IP-based line-of-sight/beyond-line-of-sight network. Using this communications hub that can move around the battlefield, numerous other users and vehicles can leverage the network link to create a mobile, high-bandwidth network that sends and receives video, data and voice.",

The Global Positioning System, operated by the United States, is the most widely used satellite navigation system in the world.  The European Union  wants to have its own navigation system -  Galileo  , which is not yet in use. The United States currently has 30 GPS satellites in orbit. The satellites send signals that enable receivers to determine their location with positioning accuracy within a few meters. This is typically used for in-vehicle satellite navigation.  The European Union  plans to have 30 satellites around 2010, with a fully operational  Galileo system   deployed  in place by 2012. The United States said the deal, to be signed this week, would see  EU  and U.S. satellites transmit information on the same radio frequencies, allowing receivers to pick up signals from both systems and combine data. The advantage of this agreement is whether the receiver manufacturer produces receivers using both systems. A senior State Department adviser said the market may drive a dual-purpose receiver. The idea of \u200b\u200ba receiver acquiring data from 60 satellites could make positioning information more precise, especially in areas with weak reception. The United States is updating its GPS system, purchasing new satellites and planning to launch them before 2013. An EU spokesperson confirmed that the agreement is still in the negotiation stage and it is not yet certain when an agreement will be reached.",

The new M110 semi-automatic sniper system has been issued to  deployed in mid-November 2007 and is in the hands of  snipers at  Fort Polka, Louisiana, USA. This is the first time this system has been equipped with troops. The M110 semi-automatic sniper system equipped with a silencer has a total combat weight of 8.5 kilograms and is equipped with 7.62 mm ammunition. This new weapon replaces the M24 manual bolt system with a quickly detachable large-capacity box magazine, so it has a higher rate of fire, allowing snipers to accurately and quickly lock on enemy targets even in densely populated areas. Another improvement to the weapon is the addition of a flash suppressor/suppressor. When snipers must change equipment to attack enemy targets at close range, the M110 semi-automatic sniper system can also eliminate unnecessary baggage. In addition, the M110 semi-automatic sniper system includes a 3.5-10x variable power rifle scope and a Picatinny rail that complies with Military Standard 1913 to enable the weapon to mount various matching accessories on the rail for use, such as The AN/PVS-26 clamp-on night sight currently equipped at Fort Polka.",

These small underwater ROVs are provided by Aurora ROV Systems of Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia, Canada, and are valued at $1.66 million each. These ROVs allow Canadian forces to see and operate objects 950 meters below the waterline. Uses include locating the location of a plane crash at sea and recovering the plane's black box. ROVs can also recover discarded items from smuggling ships, inspect suspicious items, deliver weapons to destroy mines and inspect ship bottoms. During the 2012 Nunavut military operation, the Canadian military had safely and independently used two remotely operated submersibles of the same model purchased this time in the high latitudes of the Canadian Arctic. At that time, a remotely operated vehicle was used to explore the bottom of the Northwest Passage at  805 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle and found a   that sank in 1853   Bredol Merchant ship.",

The Netherlands plans to purchase multiple JSFs to replace its aging F-16 fighter fleet. In the past, procurement was delayed due to rising costs, and now JSF's noise problem has attracted attention again. Recent data from the U.S. Air Force shows that the JSF's noise level during takeoff reaches up to 130 decibels, far exceeding the standards set by the Netherlands. The  JSF  procured by  Netherlands will be  stationed at  Levaten Air Base in the province of Frisia and environmental regulations will JSF is prohibited from taking off from the base. Due to strong requests from the Frisian Provincial Senate, the Dutch Deputy Defense Minister issued an order to conduct a new round of research on the noise problem of the Joint Strike Fighter. The Dutch national agency responsible for aerospace recalculated the data and the result was 110 decibels. Residents near Levaton Air Base and the Frisian Provincial Council have expressed concerns about the discrepancy in the data. In February 2010, the Dutch House of Representatives will again discuss the purchase of JSF or Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. The purchase plan is causing heated debate in the Netherlands because the United States does not disclose information about the actual cost of the aircraft, which means that the Netherlands may face serious financial risks. Regarding the noise causes of JSF, detailed examination of each node of the JSF project will still be carried out. However, several parties want the procurement plan scrapped, including the ruling Labor Party and the opposition Socialist Party.",

The company's innovative radar technology provides 360\u00b0 omnidirectional and \u00b145\u00b0 elevation coverage with no mechanical moving parts. ARTsys360 Company describes the  RS-400 radar  as a lightweight, low-cost, compact, reliable, low-power  micro radar system  . The radar's 100 milliwatt output means it is human-safe and complies with FCC regulations. It is said that the system can detect drones, human targets and vehicles at a distance of 800 meters at 360\u00b0. Its size and coverage means the radar could also be used to coordinate drone traffic over urban areas. According to ARTsys360, detecting drones in urban areas requires the deployment of a large number of radars to overcome the blind spots caused by high-rise buildings. The lower price of  RS-400 radar  gives it a cost/performance advantage. The radar system costs less than $50,000, compared with $150,000 to $300,000 for phased array radars. In addition, the company also said that it is developing a new radar weighing only 1kg as a drone-mounted sense and avoid sensor.",

Under low-altitude and low-speed conditions accompanied by large roll angles, large sink rates and other harsh conditions, whether safe life-saving can truly be achieved is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in the design of a new generation of ejection life-saving seats. The design of a new ejection seat of Hangyu has basically realized the life-saving needs under low-altitude, low-speed and unfavorable attitude ejection conditions through the research of a variety of key technologies. In order to further understand the life-saving performance or envelope boundary of the seat, it is necessary to compare and analyze the test data and simulation data of the two unfavorable postures, so as to provide reference and basis for further optimizing the control logic of the ejection seat. In order to successfully complete the task, the test participants overcame various difficulties such as tight time periods and completed the preparation of the two seat test pieces. The cabin class process was carefully prepared and rigorous work ensured the complete success of this test. Source: Aviation Industry Website",

This is the first time this technology has demonstrated its ability to cope with tactical situations in real time. Under the ADLT program,  Raytheon  is developing a  range-resolved Doppler lidar imaging system  to provide additional resolving power for exoatmospheric anti-personnel weapons.  The ADLT system  will improve the resolution capabilities of ground/sea-based midcourse interceptors against the most difficult threats in the future. Although it is designed for use as an exoatmospheric anti-personnel weapon, it could potentially be used to improve the capabilities of many other future versions of exoatmospheric missile systems.  The ADLT system uses an ultra-stable laser transmitter to interrogate the target like a radar system, receiving the energy reflected from the target and performing Doppler processing. It first collects range and velocity data, and then generates a The Doppler image of the resolved range can be used to understand the microdynamics of the target. The key advantage of this method is that the target discrimination distance can be very long.",

After problems occurred with the Airbus A380 transport aircraft,  EADS  launched a comprehensive  review  of the A400M project to eliminate existing risks. Research on the A400M project found some problems.  EADS  also re-evaluates demonstrated aircraft that have met performance parameters and aircraft that have not met schedule requirements. The areas of risk identified in the study were system design, particularly wiring. Wiring also affects A380 delays. But mission system maturity, engine improvements and other work to be done on the final assembly line are also cited as issues of concern.  EADS  stated that the company's two CEOs, Tom Enders and Louis Gallois, will conduct reviews every two months to resolve existing issues during the process. One of the issues to pay attention to is when the assembly plant in Seville, Spain will officially start construction. Company officials do not want to be like the A380, where final assembly begins before other preparations are completed. But it also stated that the project did not suffer from the problems of insufficient and inappropriate use of design tooling encountered by the A380. The military was briefed on the findings over the weekend. However, they are still worried about the delay in A400M delivery. These users are facing the serious aging problem of transport aircraft.",

The X-37B  separated from the Hercules rocket 20 minutes after launch. Its payload, testing and planned orbital operations have not been disclosed. The return time to the ground has not yet been determined. However, it is expected to land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in the United States, with Edwards Air Force Base serving as an alternate landing site. The X-37B project was launched by NASA in the 1990s, managed by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and later managed by the U.S. Air Force High Speed \u200b\u200bPerformance Office. The goal of the project is to shorten the time between flights from months to days, using some of the original space shuttle flight preparation funds.  X-37B  Built at Boeing's Phantom Factory, it is 9 feet 6 inches tall, 29 feet 3 feet long, and has a wingspan of 14 feet 11 inches. Unlike the hydrogen-oxygen fuel unit used by the space shuttle,  X-37B  is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells and lithium-ion batteries. The design indicator is that it can be in orbit for 270 days, and can automatically deorbit and land autonomously. With the  X-37B  orbital budget, the Air Force will be able to launch a second aircraft in 2011. U.S. Air Force officials said the component technology and subsystem technology on the  X-37B  will be applicable to future aircraft.",

The new armor, called composite lightweight improved reactive armor, can avoid the threat to soldiers and other personnel caused by metal plates and fragments produced when the standard sandwich explosive reactive armor explodes. Due to the shortcomings of standard sandwich explosive reactive armor, many countries have even banned the use of explosive reactive armor. CLARA replaces metal sheets with fiber plastic. The reason is that after being attacked by a shaped charge jet, the debris generated by the explosion of the former module is less harmful than the debris generated by the explosion of the latter module. Each CLARA module weighs 18.5kg and is only 100mm thick. The CLARA program is supported by the Defense Technology and Acquisition Agency.  BWB  has successfully conducted  trials  using the  RPG7-V anti-tank weapon  on the armor-reinforced Marder 1A5 infantry fighting vehicle. The test used the  RPG-7 anti-tank weapon  copied by Nobel Company. Its jet can penetrate 350 mm thick rolled homogeneous armor. Test results show that CLARA reduces the penetration depth of shaped charge jets into basic armor by 2 mm, and the relatively thin side armor can be easily absorbed.",

Swarms can be composed of different types of unmanned systems equipped with different sensors. DARPA is inviting other agencies to participate in the OFFSET project as sprinters. Each sprinter can launch their own innovative swarm tactic, and  Raytheon  will work with them to evaluate the tactic in a simulated or real-world environment.  In 2016,  Raytheon Company, as a participating research unit of the Office of Naval Research's LOCUST project, successfully carried out 30  Coyote drone swarms  Demonstration Verification.",

The weapons sale to the UK is estimated to be worth $650 million and includes 200 AIM-120D weapons, as well as related missile storage, support equipment and technical support. Denmark's deal is smaller, with the targeted purchase of 28 AIM-120C-7 weapons, as well as related support services and an AMRAAM backup guidance section, for an estimated cost of $90 million. These weapons may support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Both countries have agreed to purchase aircraft manufactured by  Lockheed Martin  , which has undergone successful  testing  of the  AIM-120  . In both cases, the prime contractor is Raytheon, whose Tucson, Arizona, location is the center of the company's work. Unlike the UK, which has requested industrial compensation, Denmark has requested industrial compensation and the agreement has not been finalized and will be determined during negotiations between the buyer and contractor, according to a statement from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency. As with all DSA announcements, the sale must be approved by the Senate before negotiations can begin; total quantities and dollar amounts change frequently between the initial DSA announcement and the final sale.",

The existing direct-launch TOW-2A and top-attack TOW-2B missiles have a maximum range of 3.75 kilometers. This range is limited by the length of the guidance wire.  Raytheon Company  is developing extended-range versions of these two missiles. Due to improved bobbins, the range is close to 4.5 kilometers. Moreover, TOWNG is faster and can reduce the shooter\u2019s exposure time.  The company  has also made improvements to the TOW 2B missile, improving the aerodynamic performance of the missile and using a radio frequency guidance system to increase the range. The TOW-RF missile has been specifically designated for use with the vehicle-mounted improved target acquisition system. The TOWNG series also includes TOW anti-bunker weapons, specifically designed to attack urban and bunker targets. It can penetrate concrete targets, create a hole the size of an infantryman, and have the destructive effect needed to deal with traditional civil structure bunkers. All TOW NG variants are available to new and existing TOW users through the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Office of Foreign Military Sales, including newly developed missiles, modifications of existing TOW 2 missiles, and digital launchers.

PAWS  uses image and signal processing to monitor and track the thermal plume of an incoming missile as it appears in the background around the aircraft. By tracking the missile's trajectory,  PAWS  can distinguish between threatening missiles and non-threatening missiles. When it detects a threatening missile,  PAWS  automatically alerts the pilot through an alarm signal, automatically initiates countermeasures, and provides precise information to the directional infrared countermeasures system. As part of the electronic warfare suite,  PAWS  provides threat information to other electronic warfare systems as well as avionics subsystems. It can also be used as a standalone system.",

The statement said that in order to increase the flexibility of the aircraft carrier's service life as much as possible, the aircraft carrier is designed to be a modifiable platform. In the future, it can be suitable for short-range and vertical landing aircraft as well as catapult take-off, arresting and landing aircraft. The Queen Elizabeth class is designed around a short takeoff and vertical landing joint fighter and this option is our first choice as it provides the Elizabeth class aircraft carrier and maritime air surveillance capabilities that meet the requirements of UK aircraft carrier strike requirements.

Boeing and BAE Systems have been working together to develop this capability for nearly two years.  In 2010,  Boeing's DES division conducted two field  tests to verify the system's ability to track ground targets and maintain high-precision laser aiming points .",

The launch took place at DGA's  Biscarlos Missile Test Center  and simulated a launch from a frigate. The launch scenario is very demanding. In addition to meeting the range requirements, the missile's performance must also be verified, such as using infrared target recognition technology to complete autonomous terminal navigation. This success is the result of an intensive coordinated effort involving several national departments as well as the French branches of the industrial sector).  Naval cruise missiles  will eventually equip the French Navy\u2019s multi-mission frigates and Barracuda-class nuclear attack submarines.  Naval cruise missiles  have a range of hundreds of kilometers and are used to strike deep targets in enemy territory. It is derived from the SCARP air-launched cruise missile and is a complement to the SCARP missile. Combat ships equipped with  Naval Cruise Missiles  can remain in international waters at a safe distance for extended periods of time, whether as overt frigates or concealed submarines.  Naval cruise missiles  are designed to attack high-value strategic targets. The Navy cruise missile contract was awarded by the DGA to the European Missile Group in late 2006.",

The Wall Street Journal says a Pentagon spokesman has confirmed that defective  missiles  have spread to recent weapons systems, and technicians are trying to determine the cause of the problems.  The Pentagon  made the decision after numerous failures in  tests  .  Patriot missiles  are used to defend against medium- and high-altitude aircraft and short-range ballistic missiles. Its improved version PAC-3 has a stronger ability to defend against short-range missiles. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the most likely part of the system to malfunction is the radio equipment used for navigation. Although it has not been confirmed, the problem may be caused by aging components. The malfunctioning  missile  was a  missile  that was on full alert.  The United States  has notified its ally Israel of this problem with the  Patriot missile .  The Pentagon  said it could not yet determine how long it would take to resolve the issue.  Patriot Missile  Manufacturer Raytheon and the military are conducting a joint investigation to find a solution to the problem. Countries currently purchasing  Patriot missiles  are: Germany, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia. (Qing excerpted from the Associated Press)",

The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have sufficient funds to support the APKWS project to complete system development and verify rocket guidance capabilities.  APKWS  will give the military the ability to engage enemies in urban environments, reduce casualties and property losses, and enable helicopter formations to enhance precision strike capabilities before the enemy is aware of the battle.  APKWS  is a low-cost, low-volume precision equipment system that turns standard 2.75-inch unguided rockets into precision laser-guided weapons against unarmored and lightly armored targets. The target designation system guides the rocket to hit the target with extremely high accuracy and reduce collateral damage.  APKWS  Requires no hardware changes to the aircraft, allowing military aircrews to strike targets that were previously impossible to strike due to avoidance of collateral damage. At the end of 2007, the APKWS project completed 14 verification  tests on two  helicopter platforms, including tests completed by three independent groups of crews and in various mission environments. . Research and development funds will be used to test  APKWS  conditions for application on the Marine Corps  Super Cobra helicopter .  Boeing Systems  plans to begin production of the rocket in late 2009.",

As an upgraded model of the S-300 series, the S-400 Triumph is a new type of air defense missile system. The system is designed to intercept and destroy airborne targets 400 kilometers away, which is twice the range of the MIM-104 Patriot missile and 2.5 times the range of the S-300PMU-2 missile. In April, the special commander of the air defense force said that the system could also be used for limited missile and space defense, but was not intended to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles. The air defense system is capable of destroying stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The Russian Air Defense Force is a branch of the Air Force. Currently, more than 30 regiments are equipped with S-300 missile systems, and they will all be gradually replaced by the S-400 system.",

The United States commissioned the RAND Corporation in 2004 to study possible non-traditional uses of aircraft carriers in the future. Over a six-month period, RAND assembled two research teams that included experienced military and civilian experts, defense analysts, and potential users. One group explores new uses for aircraft carriers in combat, and another examines uses for aircraft carriers in non-combatant national security or to help the country recover from a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The two research groups laid out the conditions under which aircraft carriers were used in the past and how they were used, and then looked at the circumstances in which U.S. aircraft carriers would be deployed for non-traditional uses over the next 20 or 30 years. The team looked at 12 combat or non-combat scenarios that the U.S. aircraft carrier fleet might encounter in the future. For each scenario, RAND analyzed the missions the U.S. might assign to the carriers and assessed whether the current fleet is up to the task or need. Improvements are evaluated and the tactical and technical applications required to make such improvements are estimated. The Rand Corporation made five suggestions for the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers in terms of future combat and non-combat missions, such as increasing aircraft carrier modularity, strengthening aircraft carrier detection capabilities and vitality, and increasing shipboard medical equipment.",

The competition is organized by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the International Unmanned Systems Alliance Foundation. In the competition,  students  built their own  unmanned surface boat  and needed to navigate independently to complete a series of water challenges. Project personnel from the Ship Systems and Engineering Research Branch of the Naval Warfare and Weapons Division of the U.S. Naval Research Agency said that each challenge in the competition simulated an actual maritime mission and tested the engineering of  unmanned craft design and autonomous features, while helping students develop the engineering skills needed to conduct future naval research efforts. Teams participating in the competition need to complete two required homework and five tasks. Each task requires  unmanned boat  to complete independently without human intervention. The required homework is to pass the  test  of the power, speed, navigation and basic detection capabilities of each  unmanned boat  to verify the design quality. The five tasks are to demonstrate the autonomous capabilities of the  unmanned submarine , including obstacle avoidance, autonomous parking, acoustic signal positioning, deployment, recovery, communication with the unmanned underwater vehicle, and return to the dock. Georgia Tech is this year's winner, with a $10,000 prize. Recently, the U.S. Navy has carried out a large number of unmanned system projects, including emergency comprehensive life-saving ropes, anti-submarine continuous tracking unmanned boats, unmanned boat swarms, low-cost drone swarms, etc. These unmanned autonomous technologies will provide stronger support for future operations from coastal surveillance to water rescue, from surface warfare to port security, special operations and other operations.",

Although both companies are trying their best to win the contract, the final decision will rest with the Indian Ministry of Defense. Some analysts believe that due to various reasons, the Indian Air Force may make concessions and accept the  F414 engine  from General Electric Company of the United States. One important reason is the price. The  EJ200 engine  offered by Eurojet is much more expensive than the  F414 .

    "doctext": "Landing a spacecraft on an unfamiliar surface requires a maneuver known as deep throttling. This step allows the spacecraft to throttle precisely and land at a smooth, controlled speed.  NASA  collaborated with  Pratt & Whitney  to demonstrate this control capability of the  engine , designed to enable the probe to land on the moon or other planets. A reliable and stable descent engine helps. Recently, the  Universal Scalable Cryogenic Engine  completed the last series of ignition  tests  on a 6804-kilogram-thrust cryogenic rocket prototype, increasing its capability by 35% compared with previous tests. This series of tests demonstrated the operation of the  engine  from a power thrust range of 104% to 5.9% of power. This is equivalent to an unprecedented 17.6:1 deep throttling capability, which means that this low-temperature engine can quickly control throttling. Another important goal of the test series is to test a closed-loop control system using a mixture ratio component that controls the amount of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen entering the combustion chamber. The system also monitors combustion pressure feedback during throttling. Precise control of propellant and thrust could reduce the amount of fuel needed to land future spacecraft, thereby lowering launch costs and launch quality. Landing a spacecraft on an unknown surface is a bit like driving at night, full of unpredictable challenges. When the spacecraft encounters rocks or large rocks before landing, it must throttle quickly and avoid accurately to avoid damaging the spacecraft.",

It has accumulated more than 17,600 test hours and met all ISR requirements, including reliability, durability and performance. Another milestone was the successful installation of the first production propulsion system on the  production F-35 fighter jet . \"We celebrate this achievement together with the employees of the F-35 Joint Program Office and  Lockheed Martin ,\" said Warren Poli, president of Pratt & Whitney Military Engines. Every day and every milestone, the F135 engine proves its unprecedented performance, maturity and reliability. This achievement brings us one step closer to delivering this game-changing aircraft to the U.S. military and other allies. The F135 engine has undergone a large number of ground and flight tests to prove that it can meet the different needs of the army, navy and air force. It currently remains the only engine in the  F-35  flight test program.",

An Air Force spokesman told AFP that the missiles that experienced problems on March 21 included the  Sparrow missile  produced by the United States and the  MICA missile  developed by France. The operating procedures of the staff are all correct, but the military will check it against the reference materials delivered along with the missiles by the United States and France. The  test  was conducted at an air force base in  southern Taiwan  , details of which were kept secret from the outset. In January, the media reported on a live-fire exercise in which 19 missiles were launched, 6 of which missed their target or failed to detonate successfully. On March 23, the person in charge of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reported this issue to the government, believing that it was caused by a combination of human factors and mechanical failure. At the same time, he also promised to conduct a comprehensive inspection. But this was not enough to convince the largest opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party. They believe that the occurrence of the second failure proves that military training cannot fundamentally solve the problem, and the person in charge of the Ministry of National Defense still needs to explain this issue. Previous failures did not arouse too much criticism from Ma Ying-jeou, but he only urged the military to step up training.",

PDR requires advanced EHF designs that meet or exceed customer requirements for the next generation of extremely secure military satellite systems. The advanced EHF program management manager in the Joint Program Office said the completeness of the system design and system-level requirements of the supplement clearly demonstrates the strong ties between government and national team members. The PDR confirmed that the advanced EHF system can support Air Force combat plans, provide backward compatibility with Milstar ground and space equipment, and achieve continuous coverage around the world. Its capacity is 10 times that of the traditional Milstar system. The system will provide troops with immunity to electronic jamming and support joint communications capabilities between all military EHF terminals. After the PDR of this system is successfully completed,  the national team  will switch to the PDR work of the ground and satellite parts in mid-September. When the design matures, the team will conduct a low-level component review before the system-level critical design review in July 2003. The entire advanced EHF constellation will consist of 4 intersecting satellites. These four satellites will provide secure data transmission capabilities and communications for regional and global military missions, while also maintaining backward compatibility with the Milstar system.  The first satellite  is scheduled to be launched in  December 2005    .",

On May 17, the simulated radome was equipped with C295, which is about 6m in diameter and can provide better performance within a 360\u00b0 range. The reason for choosing this layout is that it provides a new solution, that is, the radome does not rotate. The test flight will examine the air resistance of the radar.

Instead, it blindly emphasizes the establishment of multi-dimensional cooperation between allies and non-allies. Many allies have been expecting the  United States to provide a white paper and provide evidence proving that  Osama bin Laden planned and organized this terrorist attack so that Allied countries can launch attacks against it. However, Paul Wolfowitz did not prepare such evidence at all, but only listed some details about how to investigate terrorist activities and possible military actions. But he stressed that NATO allies will follow him at all levels of operations, including providing intelligence, political support, providing airspace, logistical support and  U.S.  -led military operations. \"If we need collective action, we will ask for it,\" he said. A NATO official said they had high expectations before the meeting but now appear to be disappointed. Paul Wolfowitz also used other diplomatic rhetoric to describe this as the need to handle it carefully, and that military strikes may be used, but they are not the most important factor in this operation. However, this is in sharp contrast to its tough stance after being attacked and its vow to fight the terrorists to the end and quickly deploy military forces.",

Most battlefield support helicopter pilots in the UK currently use Elbit Systems' DNVG-24T helmet-mounted display to view helicopter instrument data while observing the environment outside the cockpit. If an agreement is reached,  Ferranti  will use its low-visibility landing system to upgrade the signal data converter of the existing system so that it can display three-dimensional projection images. Pilots will be able to select and survey landing sites through a series of ground information transmitted to the helmet-mounted display through the LVL system. The upgraded system can also display machine side information and altitude/speed deviation information when other visual components fail. According to reports, the  LVL system  is connected to the helicopter's inertial global positioning system equipment and radar altimeter, and extracts digital terrain height from a map database. During the installation process of this system, no additional equipment will be installed outside the machine body. This upgrade has been  flight proven  on  Bobcat Helicopter  and  AW101 Simulator  .",

This device can reduce drag by about 0.3%, which can save operators a lot of fuel. The installation is on display in the Innovation Center in the  EADS  showroom. Weighing only 100 grams, the device can be installed at the leading edge root of each slat and reattach the airflow to the airfoil. Martin Muir, a research engineer in the  EADS  Innovation Engineering Department who helped develop the device, said that it only needs to wait for the chief engineer's order before it can be tested on an A330 or A340, so the device can be launched into the sky immediately. . Muir said this drag-reducing technology was conceived by Professor Michael Gaster, a well-known aerodynamicist at Queen Mary University in London in the 1960s, but computers capable of designing such shapes did not become available until recently. Another key factor in enabling this technology is the manufacturing method of the additional layers, which allows hundreds of such devices to be fabricated at unusually low cost.  EADS  uses titanium powder to create the device, which is beneficial for both weight reduction and corrosion resistance. The technology concept has been proven in wind tunnel testing and will then be installed on a test aircraft, using strain gauges to accurately measure how much drag can be reduced under flight conditions.",

A spokesman for the Brazilian Navy said that the design of the nuclear reactor for the  submarine  has been completed with the assistance of France, but the construction of the reactor will take place in Brazil at a later date. At the Brazilian Navy booth at the International Defense Exhibition, the Brazilian Navy exhibited two different designs of its own nuclear submarines. The first design plan comes from the Naval Technology Center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This plan divides the submarine into seven segments, with a pressurized water stack in the middle of the submarine, and eight mine launch tubes located at the front of the submarine. In the second design, there are only two torpedo launch tubes at the front of the submarine, but there are six missile vertical launch tubes. The nuclear submarine of the second option has a displacement of 4,000 tons, a length of 100 meters, and a diameter of 9.8 meters. The Brazilian Navy proposed a submarine construction project called PROSUB.  Nuclear-powered submarines  are also part of this project. Brazil and France also signed a submarine construction contract with a total price of US$4.25 billion in 2008. In addition to  nuclear-powered submarines , the PROSUB project also includes the procurement of four conventionally powered submarines.

At the same time, the radar also has all the functions of a weather radar system. The multifunctional radar will be presented to the public for the first time   at the International Radar Symposium organized by the  German Navigation Institute  . This radar system uses the most advanced active electronically scanned array technology, which can perform multiple detection tasks at the same time and the detection speed is very fast. It can replace the pilot's visual assessment of the situation. It is reported that this multi-functional  radar  can be used for military and civilian drones. The radar system will be installed on the nose of the drone and needs to be protected by an electrically transparent radome. All circuit boards have the same thickness to adapt to the aerodynamic characteristics of the platform. In addition,  Hensoldt AG has developed a special radome technology that protects the  radar from mechanical environmental impacts such as bird strikes or lightning, making it the lowest Minimally affect radar function. The architecture of the new radome is initially customized for test aircraft but can also be equipped on other platforms, with further flight testing planned for this summer.

The U.S. military is developing a  sensor  that could counter a nuclear missile from space and target it with a laser during its ascent. It is expected that in 2021, the technology of using space lasers to defeat missiles will come in handy. Richard Matlock, executive officer of advanced technology programs at the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, believes that the transition from ground-based systems to the expansion of space-based systems in the next few years is very important. Matlock believes that the United States needs a more granular system, and it is best to use space to detect countries that carry out first nuclear strikes. This would allow the United States to target nuclear missiles in the boost phase seconds after launch.  The U.S. Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct the first  interception test in  2019, and major U.S. defense contractors have announced plans to develop space-based defensive countermeasures guided weapons. The program can defeat incoming missiles carrying nuclear weapons, making it easier to protect U.S. forces from a first nuclear strike.

General Atomics's baton uses a proprietary gesture recognition algorithm to recognize standard hand movements, such as those specified in Naval Aviation Training and Operating Procedures, and then compiles and transmits these instructions to the MQ- 25 UAV, which receives instructions and converts them into appropriate actions. The size, shape and weight of the baton are the same as those used to command manned aircraft on the deck of an aircraft carrier. The MQ-25 will be able to communicate with controllers and others on the flight deck through a number of LED indicators that change color and flash, indicating that they have received instructions and displaying the aircraft's condition or operating status. Safety observers on the deck can stop the aircraft immediately if they detect a dangerous situation. The pilot can use the baton to fully control the aircraft's taxiing operations on the deck, including lowering and retracting the ejection bar, extending and folding the wings, and retracting the arresting hook. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also bidding for the U.S. Navy's MQ-25 carrier-based unmanned tanker contract, but have not yet disclosed their deck handling control technology.

A  B-1B  from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, fired two Lockheed Martin production LRASMs over Point Mugu Maritime Range, California. After launch, the two missiles passed through all planned waypoints, switched to mid-course guidance, and used missile-borne sensor information to fly to moving targets on the sea. Subsequently, the two LRASMs actively identified the intended target and successfully hit it. LRASM is based on the extended-range joint standoff air-to-surface missile design. It is a precision-guided, standoff anti-ship missile that meets the operational needs of the U.S. Air Force and Navy in challenging environments. David Helsel, LRASM program director of Lockheed Martin's Missiles and Fire Control Division, said: The success of the second dual LRASM test is of far-reaching significance. As LRASM moves toward early operational deployment by the U.S. Air Force and Navy, the weapon system continues to demonstrate key capabilities required by combat forces. LRASM applies advanced technologies that reduce reliance on remote intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance platforms, network connectivity and GPS navigation to identify and destroy designated targets within the enemy fleet. With the enhanced ability to identify targets and implement tactical attacks at longer distances, LRASM will ensure that the U.S. military opens up channels for high seas operations.",

Military off-roading must deal with 3D surfaces, hundreds of obstacles, incomplete map data, no defined road network, and no driving rules. The RACER project works to develop machine autonomy algorithms that enable unmanned ground vehicles to travel at high speeds over open and complex terrain with minimal intervention. The first phase of the project will develop, cultivate and demonstrate algorithms for lightweight all-terrain tactical vehicles in three field experiments hosted by DARPA; the second phase will mature the technology, reduce human intervention, and improve the system on long-distance cross-country and complex maneuverable terrain. speed, and conduct on-the-ground  demonstrations using  combat-sized vehicles.",

The operational test of the M270A1 project is scheduled to be completed in May 2001. The purpose of the demonstration test is to demonstrate the strength and stability of the integrated software of the  enhanced M270A1 multiple rocket launcher system . Three  M270A1  launchers were used during the reliability demonstration trials, which included a list of emergency mission events and increased the number and frequency of simulated launch missions. Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control said: In a tactical environment, we conducted 322 successful digital launch missions using a series of multiple rocket launcher munitions. Soldiers simulated the launch of standard M26 rockets, M26A1 extended-range projectiles and ATACMS projectiles. During the trial, the  M270A1 's software and hardware worked perfectly from start to finish.  M270A1  adopts an improved fire control system and a navigation and positioning system embedded with a global positioning system.  M270A1  has a friendly open architecture including a fast processor with plug and play functionality. The new launcher incorporates improved launcher mechanics to increase responsiveness and durability, which the company says reduces the time required to aim and reload. In a typical launch mission, the  M270A1  fires 6 times faster than the M270, and the reload time is reduced by about 30%.",

This move is a U.S. response to tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Captain Jeffrey of the USS Blue Ridge said that the three-day visit was mainly to emphasize the importance of regional security cooperation. This visit had been planned long before the North Korean missile crisis. After the Blue Ridge docked at the Huangpu River, he told reporters that only through this kind of cooperation can member states in the Asia-Pacific region enjoy the peace and stability they desire. An official U.S. spokesman said there are signs that  North Korea's  Taepodong 2 ballistic missile may have been filled with fuel and is about to undergo a  test launch. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo said it would pose a threat to regional security. Recently, the U.S. military invited a Chinese delegation to observe the Valiant Shield naval exercise held in the western Pacific this month. According to Xinhua News Agency, Chinese representatives were deeply impressed by the quality of the exercise. Washington is putting pressure on China to give U.S. troops more opportunities to return visits, participate in Chinese military exercises and visit Chinese military bases. In his speech, the captain of the USS Blue Ridge expressed the hope that his ship would be able to visit more other ports during its future trip to China - there are more than 1,000 sailors and sailors on board.",

The US Evening News reported that Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense has allocated US$71.75 million to produce locally designed  Hsiung Feng 3 supersonic missiles . Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense declined to comment on the report. Analysts say the  Xiongfeng 3 missile  can be adapted to a variety of guidance systems and can serve as a ship-to-ship, land-attack and anti-radar missile. The missile has a range of at least 80 miles and is designed to counter similar missiles that China has introduced from Russia.  Taiwan  displayed the  Xiongfeng 3 missile in a  military parade held  last year. It can be seen as a hint to the mainland that Taiwan already has weapons for self-defense. Beijing has repeatedly warned  Taiwan  that the mainland would invade if it declared formal independence. The tense situation across the Taiwan Strait has eased since Ma Ying-jeou came to power in May, but Ma Ying-jeou promised to increase  Taiwan 's military spending to show its determination to defend itself.",

The official also hinted that in order to prevent North Korea from conducting  nuclear weapons and missiles  transactions with other countries or international terrorist organizations, the United States has made preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction its top priority. Japan's position is that it does not accept North Korea possessing nuclear weapons. The official said that the United States handles the problem differently, showing a posture of paying more attention to non-proliferation. At the same time, he said that it must strive to achieve a  nuclear-free  North Korea. The current improvement in U.S.-North Korea relations has attracted much attention due to former U.S. President Clinton's visit to North Korea. If the United States changes its policy at this time and changes the focus of its policy toward North Korea from  nuclear  to preventing  nuclear  proliferation, Japan and other countries may be excluded. Regarding  North Korea which conducted its second  nuclear   test in  May, the United States on the one hand claimed that it would not allow it to maintain nuclear weapons; On the one hand, financial sanctions and other blockade methods are used to prevent North Korea from carrying out  nuclear proliferation. Japanese diplomats pointed out to senior U.S. officials that the U.S. posture gives the impression that it is willing to refrain from participating in nuclear proliferation. It is reported that senior US officials also expressed their desire to promote bilateral dialogue between the United States and North Korea within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, and said that consultations between Japan and North Korea should also be conducted within the Six-Party Talks. The Obama administration believes that North Korea has not developed a  nuclear missile  that can reach the United States and is therefore not a direct threat. White House spokesman Gibbs also emphasized that the biggest concern is North Korea's proliferation of  nuclear weapons and missiles  abroad.",

The U.S. Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate has issued a Request for Information regarding the  Optoelectronic High-Resolution Airborne Environmental Camera  for use in airborne reconnaissance acquisition systems.  The U.S. Army  pays special attention to mature electro-optical imaging technology, which can provide a series of continuous still frame color image sets from the lowest viewing angle of the unpressurized load bay of a manned aircraft to monitor the ground at an altitude of 3048~6096 meters. This type of camera should be able to sample at a ground sampling distance of no more than 1.2~1.8 meters at an altitude of 3048 meters, and the cross-domain viewing angle of the  camera system  should be at least 28 degrees. In addition, the  camera  should provide geolocation metadata accurate to within 30 meters. Army officials want the  cameras  to automatically correct color balance, including real-time autofocus, automatically compensate for changes in temperature, pressure and flight altitude, to ensure consistent color between missions and between cameras.  The camera  should provide fully automatic exposure, requiring no external operation, and be able to store all acquired images for a 4-hour mission.  Cameras  should have mature strapdown installation technology to overcome the passive vibration of the aircraft. Not only has the camera been fully developed  tested  but it should also have passed an initial pre-purchase evaluation.",

The primary goal of the CDAS strategy is to implement a unified, cross-platform approach to support equipment acquisition and survivability. The aim is to provide survivability through the platform while allowing for adaptation to changes in the threat environment through simple feature upgrades. At the same time, the strategy adapts to the optimization needs of life-span effectiveness and provides independent operations for the country. CDASTDP will develop an architecture that can easily integrate different types of sensors and effectors to meet the needs of a certain platform.  The company will develop a flexible open architecture that uses standardized interfaces and common programming methods to utilize various sensors and effectors installed on the platform to achieve coordinated and flexible response to threats. ability. This approach has been proven in the UK's Apache helicopters, integrating DAS controllers into the HIDAS system.

The \"2015 Strategic Defense and Security Review\" plans to increase the government budget by 12 billion pounds to 178 billion pounds, plans to purchase 8 P-8 patrol aircraft, and plans to form 2 new army strike brigades by 2025 for rapid deployment. The British Ministry of Defense awarded  BAE Systems an \u00a3859 million contract for the demonstration  verification phase of the  Type 26 frigate earlier this year, with the first batch expected to be awarded next year Construction contract for 3  Type 26 frigates first ship.  The Type 26 frigate is an anti-submarine ship with a displacement of 7,000 tons. It is planned to replace 13 Type 23 frigates starting in 2022. Official data on the cost has not yet been released, but senior naval officials said at the DSEI exhibition in London that 13 The cost of building a  Type 26 frigate is as high as 12 billion pounds. The government plans to carry out research on the concept of a new type of light frigate. The ship is light, flexible and multi-functional and will be a good complement to the  Type 26 frigate .",

Shi Technology Company is responsible, and cloud computing company VMware is also involved in some research and development work. The new generation command and control system will be used on all active alert-class and avant-garde class submarines, as well as alert-class submarines that have not yet entered service and next-generation nuclear submarines, ensuring compatibility of the entire fleet. The command and control system will enable British submarines to adapt more quickly to changing mission requirements, making operations safer and more effective.",

Roche said that  JASSM  is used to perform standoff precision attack missions. The aviation weapons and equipment of the US and British coalition forces have successfully attacked the Iraqi air defense network, so there is no need to use  JASSM  . Roche's views are clearly at odds with what some U.S. Air Force officials believe  JASSM  may be used.  Last week, a B-52H bomber launched a  JASSM  at the  White Sands Missile Launch Site   Test . This test is considered by industry and government officials to be a key test for  JASSM  to regain its license. Previously, the certificate was revoked because two  JASSM  failed to meet operational requirements. . Subsequently,  JASSM  received attention, and the US Air Force planned to mature this weapon through a series of improvements. If funded, future  JASSM  could have cyber capabilities, with the opportunity to change direction while in flight, and attack targets. It is also reported that the Royal Air Force's Tornado GR.4 attack aircraft have launched more than 30 Storm Shadow cruise missiles in Iraq, several months ahead of the official entry into service of this missile.",

    "doctext": " Recently,  American Lockheed Martin   tested and demonstrated a  new lightweight, low-cost tactical vehicle armor , capable of resisting high-speed fragmentation from improvised explosive devices and multiple attacks from armor-piercing rifle rounds. This  protection system armor that uses a large number of composite materials uses a large amount of composite materials in its anti-strike metal polymer, which will provide tactical vehicles with protection against threats such as armor-piercing projectiles, bullets, fragments and explosions on the battlefield. Protection is not only durable and low-cost, but also has good maintainability.  Lockheed Martin  stated that the armor can also be applied to tactical vehicles in urban street fighting environments, and can effectively protect against multiple projectiles or explosion shock waves following armor-piercing sniper rifle fire. In this ballistic test demonstration, the armor of this protection system successfully protected against armor-piercing projectiles and fragmentation threats while weighing less than half of the current homogeneous steel armor with the same protective effect. In addition, during the test, the protection system armor also resisted four consecutive attacks from 7.62mm armor-piercing projectiles. At present,  Lockheed Martin  has briefly reported the system to the US Marine Corps. If it can be approved for equipment testing, the test results are expected to be available later in 2006.",

Artillery  will soon improve its early warning capabilities for high ballistic weapons. This is due to the  new Raz radar system  which is expected to enter service in 2010. The radar can detect mortar shells fired into Israel. Thanks to the development of this new technology, the Israel Defense Forces will be able to provide early warning capabilities of high-ballistic rocket or missile attacks from Gaza. Major Goldring said:  The new system  can detect farther missiles, and the  radar  can deal with the threat of several missiles at the same time. The system can also be tracked simultaneously with other systems, such as drones and aviation control systems. The radar can also communicate with ground troops in real time. It contains a control system that transmits information across sea, land and air ranges to keep troops updated. Over the past few days, early models of the  Raz Radar System  completed  testing  and proved very successful. During the test, the  radar  successfully detected ballistic weapons fired into Israel. Today, Artillery uses the Nurit radar system, which allows them to detect missiles including Qigler, Qassam and Katyusha launched towards Israel. Mortar shells are currently the most terrifying weapon fired at Israel from Gaza, and the  Raz radar system  is the most targeted response equipment.",

At the same time, the U.S. Air Force is studying how to accelerate the production of precision-guided weapons that can play a decisive role in air strikes, including traditional air-launched cruise missiles and joint air-to-ground standoff missiles. According to news reports,  the U.S. Navy  is considering increasing production of Tomahawk conventional cruise missiles for retaliatory operations. Among the missiles that may be accelerated, the  JASSM  will be among the first to enter production. According to Air Force officials, after  late September  flight  testing , both the Air Force and Navy missiles will be reviewed by the Department of Defense to determine entry into the low-rate initial production phase in October. Officials were less optimistic when asked whether it was possible for small-diameter bombs to be developed and put into service as soon as possible. The U.S. Air Force is expected to announce early next month the names of the two companies that will undertake research work in the advanced development phase of components for the SDB project. The three companies competing are Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.",

India complains that although they purchase standard parts for the Indian Air Force's MiG-21 fleet, the accident rate of this aircraft remains high. Andrei Belyaninov, a Russian official in charge of arms exports, said in Moscow on August 27 that India\u2019s high aircraft accident rate is mainly because it has been purchasing some second-hand MiG parts and equipment from Ukraine, Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics. In fact, these parts have already been disuse. He also revealed that in the past ten years,  more than 220 Soviet aircraft  had  crashed  due to inferior parts. However, a spokesman for the Indian Air Force countered that India has conducted strict quality and safety inspections on imported MiG series aircraft parts, and all of them have passed the safety and quality certification of the exporting country. At the same time, it is not that India does not want to purchase MiG aircraft parts directly from the MiG factory in Russia, but that in the past eight years, the export of these parts has been deemed illegal by the Russian government. India also admitted that aging aircraft and poor maintenance are also one of the reasons for the high accident rate.",

's plan. The Russian navy also angrily refuted claims that the  submarine  was sunk by a missile that missed during a Russian military exercise. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Klibanov said that the cabinet will soon issue a formal order authorizing an action team to salvage the  Kursk . According to Russian media reports, Klibanov said: Neither the president nor the government has revised the decision made earlier to salvage the  Kursk  this summer. The Russian government will pay part of the cost of the action team, which is estimated to be US$70 million, and the remainder will be raised by an international fundraising group based in Belgium. The plan was to use a crane to lift the  Kursk  and then tow it back to the port of Murmansk by a giant barge. The salvage operation is expected to be completed by August. The government has not concluded the cause of the accident, saying only that the  submarine  explosion may have been caused by an internal malfunction, a collision with a foreign submarine or a World War II-era mine. Most Russian and foreign experts believe the most likely cause was an explosion of a drill torpedo. Some Russian media also reported that some believe the  Kursk  was sunk by a cruise missile launched by the cruiser Peter the Great during a naval exercise. British newspapers quoted an unnamed Russian admiral as saying the same thing. In response, a Russian Navy spokesman said: This is purely fabricated and not worthy of comment.",

It can control the warhead of the hard target penetration weapon to detonate after a certain delay after hitting the target, thus destroying the target more completely.  The FMU-143  is the only production fuze currently certified in the United States for use with hard target penetration weapons. Production of the fuze will be completed by L-3 Communications' Fuze and Munition Systems Division's facilities in Cincinnati and the Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory at the West Virginia Rocket Center. Allegheny Ballistics Laboratory is a U.S. Navy-owned facility operated by Alliant Technical Systems that specializes in the manufacture of advanced fuzes, conventional munitions components, rocket engines and advanced materials.

The resumption of the self-developed early warning aircraft project comes five years after the crash of the  Indian early warning aircraft    developed by DRDO in early 1999. Earlier, outgoing DRDO Director Atre said that India has developed extensive expertise in manufacturing various radar systems. Mukherjee did not say what platform  India's early warning aircraft  will use, but Indian military sources said it may be the EMB-145 business jet purchased from Brazil. India has purchased 5 such aircraft. India signed a three-party deal totaling US$1.1 billion at the beginning of this year to install Israel Aircraft Industries' Phalcon early warning radar system on three Russian-made Il-76 transport aircraft. According to official sources, the first such early warning aircraft may be delivered in early 2007.

The current Excalibur-guided artillery shells using GPS guidance already have high accuracy, with a 90% probability of hitting the target within 4 meters. With the addition of a  laser semi-active seeker , the projectile will be able to re-target in flight and be able to attack moving targets. The new version of the Excalibur shell will prepare for the upgrade of the GPS-guided Excalibur LB guided shell used around the world to have a GPS/laser semi-active hybrid guidance mode. Recent  testing  in a harsh launch environment also validated the robustness of the  laser semi-active seeker . In addition, the GPS/laser semi-active composite guidance mode can also be applied to 155mm and 127mm naval gun shells to give them the ability to attack moving targets on land and sea. Counter-small boat swarming tactics will be the primary focus of this capability. High-velocity, large-caliber, cheap artillery shells capable of attacking moving targets fired from ground or sea platforms would be a powerful weapon in countering swarming operations against small vessels.",

'We never underestimate the role of nuclear weapons...as a great equalizer,' he said. The Associated Press reported that Rogozin issued a nuclear policy statement that has been applied for many years, emphasizing that Russia is mainly concerned about Washington's conventional long-range strike capabilities. The so-called prompt global strike capability sought by the United States would allow U.S. forces to strike anywhere in the world in less than an hour using  non-nuclear weapons  . Russian President Vladimir Putin recently suggested that conventional military force will soon play an equal role as nuclear weapons in resisting foreign invasion. In response to Rogozin, a NATO official said in Brussels that the U.S.-backed military alliance had repeatedly reiterated that it did not consider Russia an adversary.

Lieutenant General Mann, commander of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Command, said that the accident investigation team has not yet made a final conclusion, but the preliminary results have increased the Department of Defense\u2019s confidence in the AHW project. The AHW program is currently a priority program within the Department of Defense's Conventional Prompt Global Strike concept. Mann said in a brief interview that the preliminary investigation results we obtained showed that the weapons and boosters were operating normally at the time, indicating that the test failure obviously had nothing to do with the booster or AHW, and that the main problem was on the launch pad. Therefore, we are full of confidence in the prospects of AHW. Mann said that once the investigation is completed, the Office of the Secretary of Defense will issue a new AHW project plan. Mann said the Office of the Secretary of Defense should approve a third test flight, which will take about a year to plan, prepare and complete.",

The Navy  also plans to equip new frigates with over-the-horizon face-to-face strike missiles to enhance combat capabilities.  The Navy conducted a  assessment on the feasibility of  two types of LCS carrying Harpoon missiles in  2014, but PMS -515 Office believes that  Harpoon missiles are too heavy and each ship can only carry 4 missiles. Plans to reduce the ship's weight and increase the number of missiles it can carry are still being studied. The PMS-515 office believes that the  Navy does not require frigates to have mine countermeasures capabilities, so the shipboard crane used to deploy and recover the underwater mine detection system can be eliminated, the weight of the ship can be reduced, and the ship can Carrying more missiles. In addition, the PMS-515 office plans to retrofit the Freedom- and Independence-class littoral combat ships to use a common combat system and a single radar. It has not yet been determined what kind of radar the LCS will be equipped with.  The U.S. Navy  will purchase the last littoral combat ship in fiscal year 2018, and begin purchasing the first two frigates in fiscal year 2019. The PMS-515 office stated that the frigate design program is time-sensitive, with only 18-20 months available for program selection.  The U.S. Navy will select and procure systems with high technological maturity before fiscal year 2017 The functional requirements of the new frigate will be clarified.",

The tail assembly resembles a non-nuclear Joint Direct Attack Munition with strap-on boosters and a GPS-assisted inertial navigation unit on the tail fin.

This missile can have a range of more than 1,000 miles and can be launched from the ground, aircraft, surface ships or submarines. It can quickly strike time-sensitive targets at long distances and is extremely difficult to intercept.  Raytheon Company  Dr. Tom Bussing, Vice President of Advanced Missile Systems, said that hypersonics is a new frontier in missile design and development.  Hypersonic missiles  will face serious aerodynamic heating problems, and their internal electronic equipment must be tightly protected, but at the same time, the weight cannot be increased, otherwise the flight speed and guidance will be affected.  Raytheon  is developing advanced materials for use in thermal shields to protect missile-borne electronics. In addition, the guidance and control of missiles at high speeds is also a big problem. Thanks to decades of experience in the development of advanced guided weapon systems,  Raytheon  is very confident in solving this problem.  Hypersonic missiles  will not replace current weapons, but will complement the US military's missile lineup.  Raytheon  plans to conduct flight  tests  of  hypersonic missiles  in the next 2-4 years. Currently, the U.S. government has funded three contractors to develop  hypersonic missiles , while  Raytheon  has also invested its own funds.",

Boeing  The EA-18G electronic attack aircraft developed for the US Navy underwent a preliminary design review in October last year. The official revealed that the review was successfully completed and the EA-18G did not have any significant design flaws. And software development and other design work is proceeding as planned. The Navy believes that the system design technology of the EA-18G is very mature and is very satisfied with the PDR results. What also makes the Navy happy is that 20% of the five-year system development and  demonstration  verification phase of the  EA-18G  project has been completed. The prime contractor of the project is  Boeing Company.  Boeing Company is very pleased with the high praise from Navy officials.  Boeing Company plans to launch the project in April this year. A critical design review of the project was conducted, and flight testing began in September 2006. Currently, two EA-18G aircraft specifically used for flight testing, numbered EA-1 and EA-2, are being manufactured. The EA-18G is a derivative of the F/A-18F Super Hornet strike fighter, designed to replace the Navy's aging EA-6B Prowler aircraft and is scheduled to enter service in 2009.",

Polikovski, said that  ABL  was successfully verified. will clear the way for the development of the project and open the door for the technology to potentially be used on other aerial platforms. The female colonel told a directed energy weapons conference that the US Department of Defense is considering various options for the future use of  airborne lasers and various platforms that may carry directed energy weapons, such as the F-35 The Joint Strike Fighter is one candidate and may carry a laser with less power than the ABL.  The U.S. Air Force's  Airborne Laser is installed on the Boeing 747-400 aircraft and is used to intercept ballistic missiles in the boost phase. However,  ABL  intercepts The target  trial cannot be carried out until  2004 at the latest.",

It plans to develop a  hypersonic aircraft with a flight speed of Mach 5 or above by the end of 2020. The successor of the Blackbird SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft, it performs high-speed strike and reconnaissance missions. The demonstrator will adopt a delta-wing twin-tail waverider structure and a turbine-based combined cycle propulsion system, in which a conventional turbine engine and a dual-mode scramjet engine are configured in parallel on the left and right, sharing an inlet and nozzle. If this plan is selected as a full-scale aircraft plan, the development work will be completed in two phases: the first phase will develop a concept demonstrator aircraft similar in size to the F-16 fighter jet, using a single engine, and conduct  flight tests; The second phase is to develop a combat aircraft with a size similar to the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft, 32.6 meters long, and using two engines.",

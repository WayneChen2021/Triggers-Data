But Jos\u00e9 , a Caracas bus driver , said he and other public transit employees were given an ultimatum by their bosses . Turn out and vote for the new congress , in an election in which nearly every candidate is a supporter of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro . Or else . \u201c They \u2019 re obliging us to vote , \u201d said the young father of two , who declined to give his last name , fearing repercussions . \u201c If not , they \u2019 ll fire us , and what are we going to do without a job ? \u201d Venezuela is not yet the kind of dictatorship that once proliferated in Latin America \u2014 with rulers who \u201c disappeared \u201d opponents , banned books and movies , and ran mass torture centers . Government pressure and violence against journalists have drastically curbed the press , but digital media outlets thrive . Hundreds of political prisoners are in jail , according to human rights groups , but opposition leaders continue to forcefully speak out . This month , the government allowed one major critic \u2014 Leopoldo L\u00f3pez , the former mayor of Caracas \u2014 to exchange his jail cell for house arrest . 1 of 46 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Protesters clash with Venezuelan security forces View Photos Thousands have been arrested , and many allege mistreatment . Caption People took to the streets to either vote in or boycott a controversial election to choose members of an all - powerful Constituent Assembly . Aug . 7 , 2017 Pro - government supporters holding Venezuela \u2019 s flag march in Caracas . Ueslei Marcelino / Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue . Yet on Sunday , critics say , an authoritarian system long in the making will be formalized , reviving memories of an era that the region had hoped was over . In defiance of international warnings , the socialist government is pushing forward with a vote to elect a constituent assembly that will have the authority to change the 1999 constitution , supplant the opposition - controlled legislature and potentially keep Maduro in power indefinitely . The opposition on Thursday called for three days of massive , nationwide protests as the government showed no willingness to back down and following the slaying of seven more demonstrators in two days . Responding to the spiraling tensions , the U . S . State Department ordered the departure of family members of American staff at its embassy in Caracas . It also authorized voluntary departures for American staff , and issued a broad travel warning for U . S . citizens . Maduro \u2014 the anointed successor of firebrand leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez , who died in 2013 \u2014 strongly defends the new assembly , saying it will fortify what he hails as \u201c the communal state . \u201d While it \u2019 s unclear exactly what he is seeking in a new constitution , it would likely give more power to \u201c communal councils \u201d in poor neighborhoods . Leaders of those councils , critics say , are government loyalists who in practice would sideline elected politicians and win direct pipelines to government funds . On the surface , the assembly vote , along with the government \u2019 s pseudo - Soviet speak , hark back to old - school Marxist regimes . But many here see something perhaps more sinister emerging \u2014 a 21st - century thugocracy that rules by coercion , extortion and violence . About 100 people have died in three months of anti - government street protests . Arrests of political activists have accelerated . Bands of pro - government toughs \u2014 known as colectivos \u2014 roam poor neighborhoods , waving guns , intimidating protesters and journalists , beating opposition politicians , and warning locals to toe the government line . [ How a new kind of protest movement has arisen in Venezuela ] More than 7 million people voted against the establishment of the new assembly in an informal referendum July 16 . Opposition parties are boycotting the election . In a country where the government is the largest employer , state workers say they are being ordered to vote Sunday , at the risk of losing their jobs . HIV patients say officials have threatened to cut off their supplies of antiretroviral drugs if they do not turn out for the election . Families risk being scratched off government food distribution rosters for not showing up \u2014 a dire outcome in a country where a socialist experiment and economic mismanagement have sparked hyperinflation and food shortages . Such threats are not idle , either . Yanelis Banco , 36 years old and nearly nine months pregnant , said her boss at the government postal service called her in along with other department heads for a talk last week . He ordered them , she said , to sign a form pledging to vote Sunday . She and five other senior staffers refused . All of them lost their jobs , she said . \u201c I \u2019 m a pregnant woman who has been working in the company for 10 years and four months , so I didn \u2019 t think they \u2019 d fire me , \u201d she said . \u201c Why do I have to sign if I don \u2019 t agree ? I thought the law protected me ! \u201d She added : \u201c All the other employees are terrified . Now they \u2019 re sure that if they don \u2019 t vote , they \u2019 ll be fired . None of them can afford that . \u201d [ Stuck in a death spiral , Venezuela is borrowing money at any cost ] Maduro has acknowledged that the government is pressuring public employees to vote . At a rally with public energy workers this month , he said : \u201c Take the lists of workers from all the state institutions and businesses to create a constituent committee . For each business , call all the workers and organize how they \u2019 ll vote on July 30th . At the end of the day , check the list . If there are 15 , 000 workers , there have to be 15 , 000 votes , with no excuses . \u201d Venezuela \u2019 s political protests have been fueled by the disastrous state of the economy , growing authoritarian rule and the government \u2019 s resistance to early elections . The country \u2019 s electoral council ruled against the opposition when it sought a referendum in 2016 that could have cut short Maduro \u2019 s six - year term . The council also pushed back elections for governors , scheduled for 2016 , to December of this year . Critics fear that the new assembly will cancel those , as well as the presidential election in 2018 . The U . S . Treasury Department in February froze Vice President Tareck El Aissami \u2019 s American assets over his alleged involvement in narcotics trafficking and took similar action against eight justices of the pro - government supreme court after it tried to strip power from the opposition - led legislature . On Wednesday , the Trump administration targeted 13 more Venezuelan officials , alleging violations of human rights and corruption . [ Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of vote ] Once the richest country per capita in South America due to its vast oil reserves , Venezuela was also cursed with vast disparities that kept an elite in luxury while the poor languished in slums . The result was Ch\u00e1vez , who used the petroleum wealth to launch massive social programs , even as he concentrated power . He remains much beloved by millions of Venezuelans , although many others \u2014 especially in the middle and upper classes \u2014 loathe him . Maduro \u2019 s approval rating , on the other hand , is hovering around 20 percent , with opponents calling this weekend \u2019 s vote the only way for him to remain in the presidential palace . He has promised Venezuelans that the assembly will herald a new era of security and stability . \u201c July 30th will be the birth of a historic trigger of the homeland for a new phase of peace and advancement , \u201d Maduro told a campaign rally this week . Yet many Venezuelans fear just the opposite \u2014 a deepening of official repression . It is already starting , they say . Take , for instance , 51 - year - old Lisbeth A\u00f1ez , or \u201c Mama Lis . \u201d For years , she was known for aiding anti - government protesters , bringing them blankets and cooking them fresh arepas , or cornmeal cakes . In May , she was arrested and charged with treason . Her case is in the hands of a military tribunal . In recent months , scores of civilians who have taken part in demonstrations or other perceived anti - government acts have been sent into the military court system , where they can face lengthy prison sentences . \u201c I can \u2019 t sleep , I can \u2019 t eat , even if we had enough food , \u201d said her son , Luis Gonz\u00e1lez A\u00f1ez , 23 , who said he was refused entry to her trial . \u201c I have nightmares , thinking about her in jail . . . I didn \u2019 t think things could get worse , but they have . \u201d Gabriela Ram\u00edrez , Venezuela \u2019 s former public ombudsman and a longtime Ch\u00e1vez supporter , said she feared the government would become worse than a dictatorship . \u201c We will have a narco - authoritarian regime , \u201d she said . Ram\u00edrez , who carries around a pocket version of Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s 1999 constitution in her purse , is among the ranks of former \u201c Chavistas \u201d \u2014 or Ch\u00e1vez backers \u2014 who have turned against Maduro . She has paid for it with harassment , she said , including a recent hack in which intimate photos of her and her husband were leaked on social media . \u201c There will no longer be any check on their power , \u201d she said . \u201c They will control everything . \u201d Following an opposition - called 48 - hour strike , the government on Thursday issued a ban on public gatherings and protests lasting from Friday through Tuesday . The opposition responded by calling for nationwide mobilization , asking citizens to take to the streets from the Caribbean Sea to the Andes Mountains . In an interview , Freddy Guevara , an opposition leader and vice president of the National Assembly , played down the chances of any deal to suspend or cancel the vote . Former Spanish prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is in Caracas , and has served as an intermediary between the government and opposition . Guevara denied reports that a deal had been offered to suspend the vote . \u201c It is wishful thinking , \u201d he said . \u201c I am sure they are going forward with this scam , and that we are going to respond with pressure . \u201d But even leading members of the opposition appear to be losing hope that Maduro will back down . Scenarios for what happens next range widely . Some observers suggest that social unrest and international sanctions will worsen , prompting , perhaps , a military coup or fueling an anti - government guerrilla movement . Others say the government , likely with the aid of Russia and China , will somehow manage to hold on as the country becomes an international pariah . Still others see a worst - case scenario of social implosion and anarchy . \u201c Somalia , \u201d said Henrique Capriles , an opposition leader and governor of the state of Miranda . \u201c We could become a failed state . \u201d Mariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report .

For the second time in a month Britain \u2019 s security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies , after it emerged the ringleader of Saturday \u2019 s terror attack in the heart of London was known to them and had been interrogated in the past . The British - Pakistani , who police are not naming for operational reasons , was also a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the east London district of Barking , where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park , sparking a complaint to the police by a local resident . The 27 - year - old , father of at least two young children , appeared also in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary , a convicted IS recruiter . Last month , community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi , the British - Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city , accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high - risk militant . FILE - A police officer stands outside Didsbury mosque in Manchester , Britain , May 24 , 2017 . At least five times locals warned the police of their fears about the 22 - year - old suicide bomber . One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK . Insufficient response Neither Britain \u2019 s domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims , but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation . FILE - Salman Abedi , the bomber behind the Manchester suicide bombing , is seen in this image taken from CCTV on the night he committed the attack in this handout photo released , May 27 , 2017 , from the Greater Manchester Police . Similar questions are being prompted again in the wake of the van - and - knife attack in the London Bridge district of Britain \u2019 s capital . Erica Gasparri , a mother of three who lived in Barking told local media she had reported Abedi two years ago , after he approached kids in a local park . She says she confronted him after her two children came home and said , \u201c Mummy I want to become a Muslim . \u201d The parents of the ringleader of Saturday \u2019 s attack are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan . According to local media , the man , nicknamed Abz , worked at various times for a fast - food outlet , a clothing store and subsequently for the London Underground system . FILE - Police attend to an incident on London Bridge in London , Britain , June 3 , 2017 . A onetime friend of the ringleader also told the BBC that he warned police , alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in Britain and of his alarm at the man ' s increasingly extremist beliefs . The friend said the alleged attacker was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric . \u201c He used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril , \u201d he told the BBC . \u201c I phoned the anti - terror hotline . I spoke to the gentleman . I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized . . . I did my bit , I know a lot of other people did their bit , but the authorities did not do their bit , \u201d he added . Security strategy review A senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday \u2019 s attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities . Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain \u2019 s counter - terrorism strategy , holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists . She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites .

Police and counter - terror officers launched further raids early Monday in east London . A police spokesman said \u201c a number \u201d of people had been detained . Local residents reported hearing bangs and gunshots during the raids . On Sunday , police arrested 12 people , seven women and five men in connection with Saturday \u2019 s terror attack .

The mortality rate for dengue fever ranges between 1 - 5 % . According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the mortality for chikungunya during an outbreak in Africa in 2005 - 2006 was nearly 0 % .

She said : What we \u2019 re thinking , based on the symptoms , is that it could be an instance of complicated cases of chikungunya . She also dismissed the rumours that the disease might be ebola , saying that as far as she was aware none of the victims had any contact whatsoever with anyone from Africa . Landaeta also called on Venezuelans to think critically , and to not fall into a \u201c collective panic \u201d regarding these diseases .

He is not charged with taking part in the April 15 , 2013 , attack , which killed three people and injured more than 260 . Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Matanov held until trial , after his attorney noted that it was unclear how the man would support himself after losing his job as a taxi driver following his arrest . She left open the option for his lawyer to seek his pretrial release if he were to find living arrangements . Matanov ' s involvement An FBI agent who had worked on his case acknowledged under cross - examination by defense attorney Edward Hayden that Matanov , who lived in Quincy , Massachusetts , had shown up at a local police station the morning of April 19 , 2013 , while a manhunt was under way for suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , to identify the man , but that the FBI had not interviewed him until the next day . Hayden noted that charging papers pointed out that Matanov had dinner with the suspected bombers , Dzhokhar and his brother , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , the night of the attack and discussed the incident . Hayden asked FBI Special Agent Timothy McElroy undercross - examination if there was any evidence that Matanov at the time had suspected the Tsarnaevs of being involved in the attack . \" There ' s nothing in here , no , \" said McElroy , consulting court papers . Pending charges Prosecutors said Matanov deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer and tried to dispose of cell phones he described as illegal after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers on April 18 , 2013 . Matanov was brought into court on Wednesday handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit .

Anti - drone unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) are to be taken for counter - terrorist test flights on a UK military base , E & T has learned . It is understood they will be flown in exercises designed to simulate a real - life pursuit of a terrorist drone . Police and the military are believed to be concerned about the prospect of terrorists modifying small , off - the - shelf drones to launch attacks on British soil . Capturing drones using swarms of net - casting UAVs working in tandem is one of several options being considered by defence chiefs . Developing radio frequency denial systems to create a forcefield - type wall around government sensitive areas could also form part of the longer - term strategy . British engineering firm OpenWorks already manufactures the SkyWall 100 , an anti - drone bazooka which launches a net at flying objects and parachutes them to the ground . However , James Rogers , an expert in drone warfare who is associate lecturer at the University of York , predicted \u201c non - kinetic options \u201d would ultimately prove more effective than \u201c blunt force \u201d tactics . \u201c There are loads of different ways to bring down a drone , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s now about finding what is the most effective way to do it . If you shoot it down , well , what if it \u2019 s rigged as an improvised explosive device ? \u201d On being told about the upcoming test flight event , he said : \u201c There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small drones , whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor . \u201d The ISIL terror group has already used basic , easy - to - buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul , where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self - styled caliphate . US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to carry hazardous chemicals , radioactive material or grenades in Western cities . Rogers told E & T : \u201c We talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare . This is kind of the other side of it . These are precision missiles . You can hone in on your exact target . Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is . \u201d Forcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre - set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum , Rogers said , although he added : \u201c You can always override that , so it \u2019 s a hard one . \u201d In the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country \u2019 s critical infrastructure . It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists . One well - placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far . Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201c just morons \u201d , he added . A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of colliding with a drone . The person controlling the drone was never tracked down . All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games , according to Dave Sloggett , who runs exercises for the police , military and others . \u201c For the last nine months , every single exercise I \u2019 ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere , \u201d said Sloggett , who has also authored a book on drone warfare . Criminals have been known to use drones to carry drugs and mobile phones into prisons , over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe . Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons . The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so - called \u201c biomimetic technology \u201d , producing drones based on natural forms , apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments . At the same time , the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Target": [[["soil", 549], ["British", 853], ["UK", 2754], ["UK", 4378], ["government", 773], ["the", 2750], ["UK", 237], ["country", 2875], ["British", 3206], ["British", 541]]], "Instrument": [[["drones", 513], ["they", 1646], ["weaponised consumer drones", 57], ["drones", 1818], ["drones", 1629], ["drones", 566]]], "Attacker": [[["terrorists", 466], ["terrorists", 2072]]], "Place": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Human_Trig": [[["attacks", 530]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["attacks", 530]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["launches", 957]]], "Random_Trig": [[["to", 4089]]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Target": [[["drone", 1289], ["it", 1416], ["it", 1391], ["drone", 383]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Attacker": [], "Human_Trig": [[["bring down", 1276]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["bombs", 1862]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["launches", 957]]], "Random_Trig": [[["and drop bombs", 1853]]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Attacker": [[["you", 1381], ["your", 2363], ["You", 2344], ["You", 2691]]], "Target": [[["it", 1391], ["drone", 1289], ["drone", 383], ["it", 1416]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Human_Trig": [[["shoot", 1385]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["explosive", 1447]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["launches", 957]]], "Random_Trig": [[["and", 398]]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Target": [[["drones", 1629], ["drones", 513], ["they", 1646], ["weaponised consumer drones", 57], ["drones", 1818], ["drones", 566]]], "Instrument": [], "Place": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Attacker": [], "Human_Trig": [[["counter", 1609]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["forcefield", 743]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["launches", 957]]], "Random_Trig": [[["carry", 2098]]]}, {"incident_type": "Movement.Transportation", "PassengerArtifact": [[["chemicals", 2114], ["material", 2138]], [["material", 2138], ["chemicals", 2114]], [["grenades", 2150]]], "Transporter": [[["terrorists", 2072], ["terrorists", 466]]], "Vehicle": [[["UAVs", 2040], ["they", 293], ["missiles", 2333], ["unmanned aerial vehicles", 145], ["UAVs", 172], ["aircraft", 9], ["These", 2313], ["UAVs", 603]]], "Destination": [[["cities", 2170]]], "Origin": [], "Preventer": [], "Human_Trig": [[["carry", 2098]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["deliveries", 4518]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["taken", 92]]], "Random_Trig": [[["prove more", 1185]]]}, {"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Target": [[["drone", 3375], ["drone", 3410]]], "Instrument": [[["it", 3334], ["Chinook", 3264], ["helicopter", 3272]]], "Place": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Attacker": [], "Human_Trig": [[["colliding", 3358]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["force", 1219]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["launches", 957]]], "Random_Trig": [[["ways to bring", 1268]]]}, {"incident_type": "Movement.Transportation", "PassengerArtifact": [[["drugs", 3889]], [["phones", 3906]]], "Vehicle": [[["drones", 3873], ["drones", 4503], ["drones", 4245], ["drones", 4098]]], "Transporter": [[["Criminals", 3840]]], "Destination": [[["prisons", 3918]]], "Origin": [], "Preventer": [], "Human_Trig": [[["carry", 3883]]], "Keyword_Trig": [[["cross", 3951]]], "LLM_Trig": [[["taken", 92]]], "Random_Trig": [[["military", 3617]]]}]}, "scenario_en_7": {"docid": "scenario_en_7", "doctext": "An unknown virus may be spreading within Venezuela ' s Aragua state , medical officials report ; however , the state ' s governor denies these allegations and accuses the official of lying .

Though no claim of responsibility was made , the attack is widely believed to have been carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA . == Background == The Rolando Cafe was located on 4 Calle del Correo in Madrid , close to the General Directorate of Security , the headquarters of the Spanish Police . It was regularly frequented by members of the police force and security services . == The attack == The bomb was placed at the entrance to the building and exploded on a Friday afternoon , during a busy lunchtime period . More than 300 people were eating in the neighbouring El Tobogan restaurant at the time of the explosion , two of whom were among the dead . The explosion caused significant damage to nearby buildings , shattering the windows of the nearby General Directorate of Security , while two cars parked nearby were totally destroyed . The bomb caused part of the Rolando Cafe ' s ceiling to collapse and guests staying in a pension above were injured due to falling through the gaps in the ceiling . The police immediately arrived and cordoned off the scene . Two of the 12 initially killed and 11 of the injured were members of the police force . However the wounded included the number two of the Spanish Political Police , with the remainder employees and customers of the cafe . A thirteenth victim died in 1977 of injuries suffered during the attack . == Responses and arrests == The leadership of ETA was taken aback by the responses to the attack and on 15 September , issued a statement denying their responsibility , though implicitly defending the bombing , claiming that the cafe was full of police agents . This caused tensions within the group , with some members believing that the organisation had to admit responsibility for attacks carried out , even if the results were not those intended . The bombing gave those opposed to further liberalisation of the country , such as Blas Pi\u00f1ar , the opportunity to attack the Prime Minister Carlos Arias Navarro . In the immediate period of confusion following the attack , some blamed the attack on the far - right . The police , however , concluded that ETA were responsible and launched an operation against the group ' s infrastructure in Madrid . Initially the police also blamed the Communist Party of Spain ( PCE ) of cooperating in the attack , but the PCE energetically denied involvement . Reports that police officers had received a circular advising them not to go to the Rolando Cafe or stand outside the building added to the mystery surrounding the incident . Leftists known to be sympathetic to ETA were arrested , including Eva Forest , wife of the communist playwright Alfonso Sastre , Mari Luz Fernandez and her relatives , Lidia Falc\u00f3n , the theatre director Vicente Sainz de la Pe\u00f1a , construction worker Antonio Dur\u00e1n , pilot Bernardo Badell and his wife Mar\u00eda del Carmen Nadal , the actress Mar\u00eda Paz Ballesteros , and the writer Eliseo Bayo . Between June 1975 and February 1976 , courts dismissed the cases and released the defendants . However Eva Forest and Mari Luz Fernandez remained in prison as they were charged with complicity in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco one year before . However , neither Forest nor Luz Fernandez were tried for the Rolando bombing , as they were released in June 1977 as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners . In 1981 Lidia Falc\u00f3n published a denunciation of Eva Forest which suggested that Forest ' s role in the Rolando attack had been considerable . The government also offered a reward of one million pesetas for information leading to the capture of Juan Manuel Galarraga Mendizabal who they suspected of being a high ranking ETA figure involved in the bombing . Exact authorship of the bombing has however remained a mystery . == References ==", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Place": [[["Cafeter\u00eda Rolando", 4]]], "Target": [[["Rolando

France \u2019 s counter - terrorism prosecutor , Remy Heitz , said an investigation has been opened for an \u201c attempted murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking \u201d and \u201c criminal terrorist association \u201d . He said no group had yet claimed responsibility for the explosion . Regional authorities said 13 people had suffered mostly minor injuries but 11 were still in hospital on Saturday morning . On Friday , the French president , Emmanuel Macron , called the explosion an \u201c attack \u201d . Heitz described video surveillance that showed the suspect heading toward the centre of Lyon by bike on Friday afternoon . The man was seen arriving on foot , pushing his bike along the pedestrian - only Victor Hugo street , then leaving a paper bag on a concrete block in the middle of the street near a bakery . French police issued this photo from CCTV showing a man wanted in connection with the explosion . Photograph : Police National / Handout / EPA The suspect immediately returned to his bike and left by the same path . One minute later , the explosion shattered the glass of a refrigerator in the bakery , Heitz said . Investigators at the scene have found screws , metallic balls , batteries , a triggering device that can be used remotely and plastic pieces that may come from the explosive device . Police issued an appeal for witnesses on Saturday with a photo of the suspect from video surveillance . They described the man as dangerous . The man was wearing a cap and sunglasses that partially hid his face . Local authorities said security has been enhanced in France \u2019 s third - largest city , including more police and military patrols . The Women \u2019 s Football World Cup is scheduled to start in France on 7 June . Lyon will host the semi - finals and then the 7 July final . After the explosion , the interior minister , Christophe Castaner , sent instructions for Lyon authorities to strengthen security for \u201c public sites and sporting , cultural and religious events \u201d . On Victor Hugo street , police removed the cordon around the explosion area and the atmosphere on Saturday was almost back to normal , with people doing their shopping \u2013 the only oddity being the chalk lines drawn by forensics on the ground . \u201c It was scary , \u201d said Gisele Sanchez , owner of a haberdashery close to the bakery . Large wood planks covered her shop window , which was damaged by the blast . Police found in her shop screws , metallic balls and batteries believed to be from the device , yet Sanchez was able to reopen on Saturday morning . France is jittery over a spate of attacks in recent years , some of them deadly , carried out by people ranging from extremist attackers to mentally unstable individuals . Five people were killed on 11 December in an attack on the Christmas market in Strasbourg , eastern France .

"wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_3": {"docid": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_3", "doctext": "There have been many terrible events in the history of Northern Ireland ' s conflict , but few have seared the collective consciousness of its people as those on Friday , 21 July 1972 , a day that became known as Bloody Friday . By the end of the day , the IRA ' s Belfast brigade had detonated at least 20 bombs across the city . In just 75 minutes of violence , nine people were dead and some 130 more were mutilated , injured and mentally scarred by what they had witnessed . You could hear people screaming , crying and moaning . The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being in the middle of the street Police officer at the scene From the outset , the IRA ' s bombing of the city caused widespread chaos and stretched the security forces to the limit . Such was the scale of the attack , witnesses at the time remember seeing people running in all directions , not knowing where the bombs were being detonated . As one report at the time described the scene , \" it was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe \" . Car bombs While the scale of the attack was huge , it was two car bombs that between them claimed the nine lives - one at the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre , the other outside shops in Cavehill Road in north Belfast . At Oxford St , the busiest bus station in Northern Ireland , four Ulsterbus workers and two soldiers were killed . When the emergency services reached the scene , they found that some of the victims had been literally blown to pieces , leading to initial estimates of a death toll of 11 . At the Cavehill Road bomb , the victims were two women and a 14 - year - old schoolboy . Of the 130 injured , 77 were women or children out shopping in the city centre . One police officer at the scene recalled the events for the BBC series Provos in 1997 . \" You could hear people screaming , crying and moaning . The first thing that caught my eye was a torso of a human being lying in the middle of the street , \" he told the series . Collapsed ceasefire In terms of furthering its cause among nationalists , the IRA ' s decision to carry out the Bloody Friday attacks proved to be a disaster . Earlier in the year , the IRA had experienced a massive propaganda and recruitment boost after the Parachute Regiment killed 13 protesters during Bloody Sunday in Derry . Many joined believing that they had no other way to defend their communities . It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time . Former IRA leader Sean MacStiofain By June , the organisation felt confident enough to call a ceasefire and hold secret talks with British ministers in London . Those talks came to nothing and the ceasefire collapsed . Bloody Friday was part of a deliberate decision to ratchet up a campaign and make normal life impossible . But after causing the deaths , the IRA tried to blame the security forces for failing to act on warnings . Ultimately Bloody Friday revealed a side to the organisation that many who had joined in the wake of Bloody Sunday had not wished to acknowledge . Within 10 days of the attacks , the army moved in to the Bogside area of Derry to take control of a part of the city that had become out - of - bounds , marking the beginning of a long war of attrition by both sides . Denials In later years , an IRA leader at the time , Sean MacStiofain , said that the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he still refused to accept responsibility . \" It required only one man with a loud hailer to clear each target area in no time , \" he said . \" Republicans were convinced that the British had deliberately disregarded these two warnings for strategic policy reasons . \" Bloody Friday was by no means the last atrocity of 1972 . It remains the bloodiest year of the conflict in Northern Ireland . By the end of 1972 , 496 had been killed , 258 of them civilians .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Conflict.Attack", "Instrument": [], "Place": [], "Target": [], "ExplosiveDevice": [], "Attacker":

2018 The Russian Republic of Dagestan , which translates as \" land of the mountains \" , is situated in Russia ' s turbulent North Caucasus with Chechnya and Georgia to the west , Azerbaijan to the south and the Caspian Sea to the east . So high are its peaks in some places that certain areas are accessible only by helicopter . The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity , being home to more than 30 languages . Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries . image copyright AFP image caption Villages cling to steep hillsides in Dagestan ' s spectacular mountainous interior The Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population . A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins , Kumyks and Lezgins . About 10 per cent are ethnic Russians . There are also Laks , Tabasarans and Nogai , to name but a few of the other significant groups . The republic ' s constitution declares the protection of the interests of all of Dagestan ' s peoples to be a fundamental principle . It is a delicate balance to maintain , in what is Russia ' s most ethnically diverse province . The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea . However , it is prey to organized crime and regional instability . The crime barons may prosper but the people are amongst the poorest in Russia . History Dagestan was the birth place of Imam Shamil , the legendary fighter who in the 19th century spearheaded fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire . His name is still revered by many in both republics . image copyright AFP image caption Federal troops were deployed to repel incursions by Chechen militants in the 1990s When the Bolsheviks sought to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s , Dagestan became an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation . During the Stalinist period , its peoples escaped the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others . After the fall of the Soviet Union , the republic ' s authorities stayed loyal to Russia , but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption . Organised crime is reported to flourish and kidnappings and violence are commonplace . Firearms are ubiquitous and assassinations are a regular event . Moscow blames much of this on Chechen - based separatism , but others say lust for profit , combined with a gun culture , is the root cause . Budennovsk and beyond In the 1990s , separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechen openly led armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions . In 1995 and 1996 , they seized hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar . Scores died in the attacks . image copyright AFP image caption Dagestan sees frequent attacks on security forces and assassinations Dagestan ' s Muslims , who tend to follow sufism combined with local tradition , generally steered clear of Chechen - style separatism , but after the late 1990s , radical and militant elements said to be linked with the more fundamentalist wahhabist tendency began to gain in influence . In August 1999 , an Islamic body declared an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya , and called on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war . Chechen fighters crossed into Dagestan in support , but within a few weeks , Russian forces had suppressed the insurrection . The republic has seen numerous bombings targeted at the Russian military stationed in the republic .", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Contact.Contact", "Participant": [[["republic", 996],

truck rental agency in Junction City , Kan . , identified Timothy McVeigh in court Friday as the man who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building . \" I was looking right at him , \" declared Eldon Elliott , owner of Elliott ' s Body Shop , recalling the two occasions when McVeigh , now 29 , entered his shop -- on April 15 , 1995 , to reserve a truck and pay the $ 280 . 32 rental fee in advance ; and on April 17 to pick up the 20 - foot Ryder truck . He said McVeigh used the name \" Robert Kling . \" \" That ' s the way I look at everybody , \" he told jurors and U . S . District Judge Richard Matsch . \" I look at them right square in the face . \" \" Is there any doubt in your mind ? \" asked Justice Department prosecutor Scott Mendeloff . \" No , \" Elliott replied . \" Who was it ? \" Mendeloff asked . \" Timothy McVeigh , \" Elliott said . Asked to point him out , Elliott gestured to the defense table . \" Right over there . Blue shirt . \" McVeigh sat stone - faced , wearing a blue oxford shirt with long sleeves rolled up . He did not acknowledge Elliott ' s identification . The testimony came on a day when prosecutors presented a series of witnesses and documents , including telephone records , a taxi log and a Chinese food takeout order , as well as surveillance photos from a McDonald ' s restaurant , to trace McVeigh ' s movements from April 14 , 1995 , when prosecutors say he arrived in Junction City , until April 17 , when the Ryder truck was driven from Elliott ' s shop around 4 : 30 p . m . The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was shattered by an explosion at 9 : 02 a . m . on April 19 , 1995 , killing 168 people and injuring more than 500 others . McVeigh is on trial on charges of murder and conspiracy . Prosecutors claim McVeigh arrived in Junction City on April 14 , where he sold his car and purchased a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis . He allegedly walked to the J and K bus depot where he called Elliott ' s to obtain a price quote on a Ryder truck rental . According to testimony , McVeigh checked into the Dreamland Motel later that day and stayed until the 17th . Prosecutors say he drove the truck to Geary Lake in Kansas , that 4 , 000 pounds of ammonium nitrate laced with nitromethane were loaded into the truck there , and that it was driven to Oklahoma City and detonated . Elliott testified that on April 15 , McVeigh came to the body shop and reserved the truck , to be picked up at 4 p . m . two days later . Elliott said that McVeigh gave him the $ 280 . 32 in exact change after declining to pay an additional amount for insurance . He rented the truck using a driver ' s license in the name of \" Robert Kling \" that showed an address in Redfield , S . D . , Elliott said . To piece together McVeigh ' s movements , prosecutors called Yuhua Bai , owner of Hunam Palace , in Junction City , who testified that shortly after 5 p . m . on April 15 she took a phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a caller who gave the name \" Kling \" and requested delivery to Room 25 at the Dreamland . According to previous testimony , McVeigh was assigned Room 25 . Phone records indicated were shown to the jury indicating that a call was made from that room to the Hunam Palace at 5 : 17 p . m . on the 15th . Prosecutors also called David D ' Albini , manager of the McDonald ' s at the time , who narrated surveillance photographs taken in the restaurant April 17 . Watching a TV monitor , jurors saw McVeigh , clad in a plaid shirt and jeans , approach the counter and later walk out of the restaurant .

"doctext": "A statement after a two - hour emergency meeting at Stormont Castle , said that Mr Whitelaw , the defence secretary , Lord Carrington , and army and civilian advisers , had considered the Provisional IRA ' s \" bombing outrages \" . \" They deplored the slaughter and maiming of men , women and children , which took place today on Provisional IRA orders , clearly acting with the utmost ferocity . In the light of these murderous attacks , the ministers authorised certain operations against the terrorists to be undertaken forthwith . \" Early today Mr Whitelaw gave an interview to the BBC about forthcoming security measures . He said : \" I am going to make an immediate and clear response to the ghastly attacks on innocent people that have taken place in the last 24 hours . \" This will be a clearly determined operation that will do everything possible to root out those responsible for these appalling crimes . \" He added that the measures would become apparent \" very soon \" . On the question of the possible reintroduction of internment , he said : \" The internment of suspects is never ruled out , but I don ' t contemplate it with any pleasure . \" Shootings in Belfast had continued last night . In one incident , a man was killed and five more were wounded , in a battle between troops and terrorists in the Markets area . The army claimed to have hit three gunmen . Later , a man was shot dead when he answered a knock at his door in Deerpark Road , in the Old Park district of the city . Just after 11 . 30pm a wave of shooting broke out in the main Catholic areas . The army said that the initial shooting incidents did not involve the security forces , but that after midnight their posts in Anderstown and the Old Park Road came under intense gunfire . There were no military casualties . In the afternoon , during an hour of concentrated bombing at least 11 people died . They included two soldiers , a little girl and a messenger boy . Ninety six people were detained in hospital , and about 24 others were allowed home after treatment . The Provisional IRA accepted responsibility for the bombings , which seemed to be aimed at civilians . It claimed that at least 30 minutes ' warning was given before each explosion , but the warnings which were received were so vague as to be almost useless . A spokesman for the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA pointed out that telephoned warnings were given to the Samaritans , the police , newspapers and the local Rumour Service and Public Protection Service at least thirty minutes before each explosion . In the case of the two worst explosions at Oxford Street and the Cavehill Road , warnings were given well in advance . The Oxford Street warning was heard over the military radio net at 2 . 10pm , and a woman telephoned the police telling of a box in the back of a car on the Cavehill Road an hour before the explosion . Huge explosive decides were detonated at places certain to be thronged with people - bus termini , railway stations , and shopping centres . It was calculated that over 1 , 000lb of explosives had been used . At 2 . 45pm , when the bombing began , and for much of the afternoon , Belfast was reduced to near total chaos and panic . Girls and men wept openly , hugging each other for safety in the main streets , as plumes of smoke rose around them , and dull thuds echoed from wall to wall . It was impossible for anyone to feel perfectly safe . As each bomb exploded there were cries of terror from people who thought they had found sanctuary , but in fact were just as exposed as before . Thousands streamed out of the stricken city immediately after the attacks , and huge traffic jams built up . All bus services were cancelled , and on some roads hitch hikers frantically trying to get away lined the pavements . By the time it was all over , some 21 bombs had gone off in Belfast and there were fears of more to come . Sources close to the Provisionals indicated that more were planned for last night and for the weekend . Mr Whitelaw and Lord Carrington immediately flew back to Belfast in an RAF transport plane for their emergency meeting . The army GOC , Sir Harry Tuzo , the acting chief of the RUC , Mr David Corbett , and one of Mr Whitelaw ' s juniors , Mr David Howell , also attended . From at least two Ulster Protestant politicians , there were urgent demands last night for an immediate resumption of the internment policy . One of them , Mr William Craig , leader of Ulster Vanguard , and a former Stormont Cabinet Minister , called for its \" immediate massive resumption \" . While this course was not thought one of those Mr Whitelaw was more likely to pursue , it was felt that stringent security measures must now be enforced . The possibility that a major cordon - and - search operation may now be undertaken in one of the prime Republican areas - possibly even in the Andersonstown estate where the Belfast IRA leaders meet and plan their main operations - is becoming very real indeed . If Mr Whitelaw does not act swiftly , there is little doubt here that understandably militant Protestants , headed by the huge and formidably well disciplined Ulster Defence Association , may decide to take the law into their own hands . Last night the UDA leaders were meeting in emergency session in a house in the city and refused to comment on their plans . They did stress , however , that no action was contemplated for some hours . But only four hours after the bombing , UDA car and foot patrols were seen on the streets in East Belfast . Presumably they were there in a defensive role for a very frightened and intimidated Protestant population . The bombs began to explode before 3pm . Then for roughly 20 minutes they exploded roughly at one a minute . Smoke appeared in all directions above the roofs of shops and offices . As the attacks continued , and the whole city centre echoed to the crack of the bombs , a few people began to panic . Weeping children had to be comforted by their mothers , and passers - by had to strike hysterical girls to bring them under control . The worst explosion was at the busy Oxford Street bus station , where at least six people were killed . Reports by witnesses said that the bomb had been planted in a car . As a Land - Rover containing Welsh Guardsmen arriuved , it exploded , killing two soliders instantly and tearing through the waiting - room", "templates": [{"incident_type": "Life.Die", "Victim":
